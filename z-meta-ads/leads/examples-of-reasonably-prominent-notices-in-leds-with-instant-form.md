# Examples of Reasonably Prominent Notices in Lead Ads with Instant Form

## Overview

Meta requires you to inform people about why you're collecting their contact
information and how you plan to use or share it to comply with our Lead Ads
Terms. You can create a reasonably prominent notice while creating a lead ad,
and it'll be shared with people before they submit the lead ad with instant
form.

## Notice Placement

This reasonably prominent notice appears above the contact information you're
requesting in the form. It should include details on:

- Why you're collecting this information
- How you plan to use or share it

## Implementation

To include a reasonably prominent notice, use the **Description insertion
field** below the **Prefill questions** expandable in the **Questions section**
during instant form creation.

## Example Notices

You can create your own reasonably prominent notice or modify one of these
examples to fit your needs:

### Example 1: Newsletter Subscription

> "We'll use your information to send you our weekly newsletters."

### Example 2: Events and Partners

> "We'll use your information to contact you about our events. We may also share
> your data with our partners who may reach out to you about their products and
> services."

### Example 3: Property Showings

> "We'll use your information to sign you up for a property showing and will
> keep you informed about additional properties for sale in the area."

### Example 4: Quotes and Financing

> "We'll use your contact details to send you online quotes. We will also share
> your data with trusted partners who may reach out to you regarding financing
> options."

## Important Compliance Rule

**You may only use the information collected for the purposes stated in the
reasonably prominent notice.**
