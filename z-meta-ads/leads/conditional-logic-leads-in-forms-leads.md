# Use Conditional Logic in Instant Forms to Qualify Your Leads

> **Note**: This feature is only available through lead ad with instant form
> creation in Meta Ads Manager.

## Overview

When you create a lead ad with instant form, you can use conditional logic to
create a dynamic form. This dynamic form changes what question or landing page a
person sees next based on their answer in real time.

Conditional logic can help you:

- Collect the information that is most important to you
- Filter out leads that don't meet your criteria
- Direct different categories of leads to specific landing pages to encourage
  conversions

## Important Considerations

- The use of conditional logic may increase your cost per lead
- Instant forms that include conditional logic can be delivered to desktop and
  mobile on both Android and iOS platforms
- Once your ad is approved, your instant form will show your conditional
  question to everyone who views the form
- Only the people who answer with a response determined to be a lead will be
  able to submit the form and qualify as leads
- You won't receive the information for anyone who responds with an answer that
  closes the form
