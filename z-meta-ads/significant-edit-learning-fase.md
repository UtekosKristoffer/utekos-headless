Significant edits and learning phase
Every edit you make (during the learning phase or after it) has some effect on delivery, but not every edit causes the ad set to reenter the learning phase. Only a significant edit causes an ad set to reenter the learning phase. During the learning phase, the delivery system is exploring the best way to deliver your ad set based on the optimization event you chose for your ad sets. This can lead to less stable performance and a higher cost per result.

The following are considered significant edits:

Any change to targeting
Any change to ad creative
Any change to optimization event
Adding a new ad to your ad set
Pausing your ad set for 7 days or longer (the ad set reenters the learning phase once you unpause the ad set)
Changing bid strategy
Note: When using Advantage+ campaign budget (also known as Campaign budget, or Budget with Advantage+ on), switching your campaign bid strategy might cause multiple ad sets within the campaign to reenter the learning phase.
A change to any of the following areas may or may not be significant, depending on the magnitude of the change:

Ad set spending limit amount
Bid control, cost per result goal or ROAS goal amount
Budget amount
Note: When using Advantage+ campaign budget, adjusting your campaign budget might cause multiple ad sets within the campaign to reenter the learning phase.
For example, if you increase your budget from $100 to $101, that isn't likely to cause one or more ad sets to reenter the learning phase. However, if you change your budget from $100 to $1000, one or more ad sets may reenter the learning phase.

Common questions about Advantage+ campaign budget and learning phase
How long does the initial "learning" process typically take for ad sets with Advantage+ campaign budget? It'll take the same time as ad set budgets.
Will Advantage+ campaign budget cause ad sets to reenter the learning phase as it distributes budget? No, ad sets within the campaign won't reenter the learning phase as budget is distributed.
Will making a significant edit to one ad set (meaning the edit is made at the ad set level) cause other ad sets within the same campaign to reenter the learning phase? No, as long as the edit is made at the ad set level, other ad sets within the same campaign won't reenter the learning phase.
Will adding a new ad set to the campaign cause the rest of the ad sets to reenter the learning phase? No, adding an ad set to a campaign with Advantage+ campaign budget won't cause other ad sets within the same campaign to reenter the learning phase.
Is changing my disclaimer for ads about social issues, elections or politics considered a significant edit? Yes, changing the disclaimer you place on the ad is considered a significant edit.


About learning limited
If your ad set isn’t getting enough optimization events to exit the learning phase, the Delivery column reads Learning limited. Learning limited isn’t a penalty – it’s an indication that your budget isn’t being spent effectively because the ad delivery system can’t optimize performance with your current setup.

An ad set becomes learning limited when it is unlikely to receive about 50 optimization events in the week after your last significant edit. This diagnosis can happen any time after you create an ad set or make a significant edit to an existing one.

Note: For Shops ads, an ad set becomes learning limited when it hasn’t generated a minimum of 17 purchases through your website and 5 through Meta after 7 days.

Generally, an ad set becomes learning limited when the ad set is limited by small audience size, low budget, low bid or cost control, high auction overlap, an infrequent optimization event, or other issues such as running too many ads at the same time. If an ad set is limited by a low bid or cost control, a tooltip will appear when you hover over the learning limited status.

Troubleshoot learning limited
There are multiple ways to fix learning limited ad sets to improve performance.

Combine ads sets and campaigns. Combining ad sets and campaigns will help you get the results you need faster, which means you’ll see stable results sooner.
Expand your audience. The larger the audience, the more opportunities for people to complete your optimization event.
Raise your budget. If your budget is too low to receive enough optimization events, the ad set is unlikely to exit the learning phase.
Raise your bid or cost control. If your bid or cost control is too low to receive enough optimization events, the ad set is unlikely to exit the learning phase.
Change your optimization event. Consider choosing an optimization event that occurs more frequently. For example, move from purchases to add to cart. To better understand if your ad set is getting enough optimization events, you can add them as a reporting column in Ads Manager. To see your optimization events:
Open Columns.
Click Customize columns and check Optimization events.
Click apply.
If a learning limited ad set receives enough optimization events since your last significant edit, it will move from Learning limited to Active.
