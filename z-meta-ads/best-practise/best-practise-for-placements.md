# Best Practices for Placements

## Use All Placements

We recommend remaining opted into all placements across Facebook, Instagram,
Messenger, Threads and Audience Network using **Advantage+ placements**. This
will allow the Meta delivery system to allocate your budget across multiple
placements based on where they're likely to perform best.

## Use Diverse Assets

Use **Advantage+ creative** in combination with **Advantage+ placements** to
help ensure the right creative is in the right placement to increase the
likelihood your ad will resonate with your audience.

Consider using **placement asset customization** to tailor your creative for
different placements.

## Use Placement Controls Where Needed

If you have a hard constraint and need more control over where your ads appear,
use account level placement controls to exclude specific placements or
platforms.

**Note:** Be aware that this may limit the effectiveness of Advantage+
placements.
