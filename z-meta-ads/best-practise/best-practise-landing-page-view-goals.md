# Best Practices for Landing Page View Performance Goals

Setting performance goals for landing page views improves the quality of traffic
your site receives from ads.

## Goal-Based Recommendations

### Increase Traffic to Specific Pages

- **Recommended**: Landing page view optimization
- **Why**: Improves traffic quality compared to link click optimization

### Increase Conversions

- **Primary recommendation**: Optimize for conversions first
- **Requirements for conversion optimization**:
  - Ad set needs ~50+ conversions per week minimum
  - Lower-funnel events (e.g., purchase conversions) must be configured with
    Meta Pixel
- **Alternative**: Use landing page view optimization if:
  - Your ad set generates fewer than 50 conversions per week
  - Lower-funnel events are not yet set up

### Ads Leading to Facebook Page or Video

- **Ad formats**: Offers, Messenger, or similar
- **Recommended**: Set performance goal to "Maximize number of Facebook Page
  visits"
- **Not recommended**: Landing page views

## Opportunity Score Integration

When eligible, you can receive experimentally proven landing page view
recommendations through opportunity score.

  performance

- Opportunity score does not guarantee performance results
