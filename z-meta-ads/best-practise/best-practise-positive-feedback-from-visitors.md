# Best Practices for Positive Page Feedback from Customers

Meta's ad and commerce technologies are designed to maximize value for people
and businesses. That's why Meta collects feedback about customer experiences
following a conversion that occurs after a person clicks or views an ad on Meta.

## How Meta Uses Customer Feedback

Meta uses customer feedback to:

- Help inform which ad to show in the ad auction
- Better connect businesses with customers who are more likely to have a
  positive experience
- Reduce negative experiences for people who use Meta technologies by reducing
  the chance that they'll interact with ads from businesses that received
  negative feedback, including ones that are potential scams

## Impact of Negative Feedback

**Important:** If a business regularly receives negative feedback from customers
who interacted with its ads, the ads may reach fewer people. To improve
feedback, Meta recommends that you regularly consider the items listed in the
sections below.

## Best Practices for Setting Customer Expectations

### 1. Be Clear About What You're Selling or Offering

- **Accurate representation:** Pictures, videos and all other ad creative should
  accurately represent what you sell. Ensure dimensions, sizes, materials and
  all other aspects of your product are accurately shown and stated.
- **Size charts:** If you sell apparels, ensure the size charts you use work for
  other countries that you sell to (for example, United States sizing may be
  different than sizing in China).
- **Quality control:** If you source goods from suppliers, ensure you maintain
  quality control and that the goods are shipped on time and as stated on your
  website and ad.
- **Safety warnings:** State warnings clearly to inform customers about
  potential hazards such as possible allergens by listing the ingredients in
  your products.

### 2. Set Clear Expectations for Shipping

- **Accessible policies:** Make your Terms and Conditions, including your
  delivery, shipping and return policies, accessible and understandable.
- **Accurate timing:** Door-to-door shipping time should be accurately conveyed.
  The shipping information you provide should be inclusive of:
  - Handling and processing times
  - Item availability
  - Shipping costs
  - Any other factors that may impact the amount of time an item takes to ship
- **Tracking information:** If possible, provide tracking information about the
  shipments so that the customers can track their packages.

### 3. Set Clear Expectations for Customer Service

- **Honor policies:** Honor any return and exchange policies advertised on your
  website.
- **Response times:** If you operate in a different time zone than your
  customers, be clear about how long it takes to reply back to customer
  inquiries.
- **Order updates:** Update customers if there are any changes to their order
  such as:
  - Delayed delivery
  - Temporarily out of stock products

### 4. Make Sure You Can Meet Customer Demand

- **Scale appropriately:** Scale your advertising with your business's ability
  to deliver products. If your inventory is limited, you may want to consider
  running fewer ads, or make it clear to customers before they purchase when the
  products are expected to be in stock and shipped.
- **Proactive communication:** Be proactive about telling customers when you
  can't fulfill what was promised (for example, you've run out of inventory, and
  it will now take longer than expected to replace an order).
