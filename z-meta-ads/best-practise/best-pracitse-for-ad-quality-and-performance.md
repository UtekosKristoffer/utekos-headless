# Best Practices to Improve Ad Quality and Performance

At Meta, we prioritize analyzing ads to detect any violations to our low quality
or disruptive content advertising policy. Below is information on how best
adhere to our best practices for improved ad quality and performance. Learn more
about our advertising policies in our
[Transparency Center](https://transparency.meta.com/).

## How Meta Analyzes Ad Quality

Meta conducts research and analyzes feedback from our community to understand
which attributes of ads are low-quality, diminishing value for people and
businesses.

If advertisers repeatedly post policy violating or low-quality ads, our system
may associate their Page, domain, ad account or other associated entities as
lower-quality, making ads created from these entities less competitive in
auctions.

That means it will cost more and advertisers will see fewer results than if the
ads did not contain these attributes and associations. Advertisers can maximize
ad performance by understanding and avoiding the following attributes.

Below are some of the key low-quality attributes of ad content and post-click
experiences. If an ad contains any of these attributes, the ad quality component
of an ad's total value may be relatively low.

## Attributes of Low-Quality Ad Content

### Withholding Information

Ads that withhold information in order to entice someone to click a link to
understand the full context of something.

**Examples:**

- Clickbait ads

### Sensationalized Language

Includes using exaggerated headlines or commanding a reaction from people to a
degree that creates an unexpected experience when people click to a landing
page. For additional tips on removing this and other forms of clickbait, see our
[publishing best practices](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/publisher-standards).

**Examples:**

- Sensationalized ad language

### Engagement Bait

When an ad uses spammy content that urges people to engage with it in an
inauthentic way to get more likes, comments and shares.

**Examples:**

- Illustrations of engagement bait in ads

> **Reminder:** If we detect that an ad violates our low quality or disruptive
> content advertising policy, we'll reject it.

> **Note:** Account Quality is now Business Support Home

## How We Measure Ad Quality

To measure ad quality, we monitor for certain actions and signals that people
may take or provide when engaging with an ad. These include:

- Hide ad
- Hide all ads from this advertiser
- Hide ad due to repetition
- Report ad
- Landing page bounce rate
- Landing page dwell time

> **Note:** If we detect that an ad violates our low quality or disruptive
> content advertising policy, we'll reject it.

## Attributes of a Low-Quality Ad Landing Page Experience

- **Lack substantive or original content**
- **Disproportionate volume of ads relative to content**
- **Pop-up ads or interstitial ads:** This includes any ads that disrupt the
  user experience–it doesn't include legally required disclosures or logins to
  private content, like paywalls
- **Unexpected content experiences:** This includes, for example, spreading an
  article's content across multiple pages and requiring someone to click and/or
  load multiple pages to read through the full article
- **Misleading experiences:** This includes websites that misrepresent products,
  expected shipping times, customer support experiences and associated feedback
  from customers such as being dissatisfied with advertising

## Policy Compliance

Advertisers are expected to understand and comply with all relevant policies. As
a reminder, regardless of low-quality attributes, all ads and landing pages must
abide by our Community Standards and Advertising Standards, including:

- Adult content
- Non-functional landing page
- Low quality or disruptive content
- Sensational content
- Commercial exploitation of crises and controversial events
- Unrealistic outcomes
