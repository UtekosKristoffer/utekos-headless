# About Ad Quality

## How Ad Quality Works

Our ad system is designed to maximize value for people and businesses. Higher
quality ads perform better in the auction because we've designed the auction to
help create higher quality experiences for people.

**Ad quality is determined by:**

- Analysis of many sources
- Feedback from people viewing or hiding the ad
- Assessments of low-quality attributes and practices

## Why Ad Quality Matters

### Performance Impact

Your ad will perform better in the auction if it's higher quality. Ads with a
lower quality ranking tend to:

- Cost more
- Have reduced distribution
- Lead to fewer results

### Systemic Quality Assessment

In certain instances, if you repeatedly post policy-violating or lower quality
ads, our systems may start considering **all ads** from your associated entities
as lower quality:

- Page
- Domain
- Ad account
- Other associated entities

### How to Improve

You can improve your ad performance by:

1. Recognizing instances of low-quality attributes
2. Removing them from your ads
3. Ensuring your Page, domain, ad account or other associated entities comply
   with Meta Advertising Standards

Over time, your ad performance should improve.

## How to Check the Quality of Your Ad

You can check the quality of existing ads in **Meta Business Support Home**.
This is a centralized place where you can monitor and resolve account issues,
review the status of your:

- Business portfolios
- Ad accounts
- Commerce accounts
- Catalogs
- Pages

### Additional Capabilities in Business Support Home

- Address issues that may need attention due to not complying with our
  Advertising Standards, Commerce Policies or other policies and terms
- Learn what actions you can take if your account or Page has been disabled or
  restricted
- Request a review of ads or assets that you believe may have been incorrectly
  rejected

## How to Determine Ad Quality

You can measure the quality of your ad relative to other ads competing for the
same audience by using **quality ranking** in ad relevance diagnostics.

In certain instances, we'll send you a notification so you know when low-quality
attributes are severely affecting the performance of your ads.
