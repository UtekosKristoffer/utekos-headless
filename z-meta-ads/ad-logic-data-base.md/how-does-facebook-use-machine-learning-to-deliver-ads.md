# Good Questions, Real Answers: How Does Facebook Use Machine Learning to Deliver Ads?

Delivering personalized ads maximizes value for both people and businesses. It
helps businesses reach customers affordably, grow and create jobs, and provides
people a better experience. Our latest Good Questions, Real Answers post will
help you understand how Facebook delivers this value through ad auctions that
use machine learning to determine which ads to show to people on our apps.

## How does Facebook decide which ads to show people?

We determine which ads to show people based on two main factors: audience
targeting selected by advertisers and the results of our ad auction.

### Audience Targeting

First, advertisers choose their target audience through our self-service tools.
Audiences are created based on categories like:

- Age and gender
- Actions people take on our apps (e.g., liking a Facebook Page or clicking on
  an ad)
- Custom audiences (e.g., list of emails or people who've visited their website)
- Lookalike audiences

### Ad Auction Process

Next, when determining which ads to show someone, our system gathers ads that
include that person in the advertiser's chosen audience. These ads move to the
auction stage.

For ads that enter the auction, Facebook selects the top ads to show to a person
based on which ads have the **highest total value score** — a combination of
advertiser value and ad quality.

#### Total Value Score Calculation

1. **Advertiser Value** = Ad's bid × Estimated action rate
2. **Ad Quality Score** = Overall quality determination of the ad
3. **Total Value Score** = Advertiser Value + Ad Quality Score

We use machine learning to inform this process, as we explain below.

## What is machine learning and how does Facebook use it to inform ad delivery?

Machine learning is a system that learns as it receives new data, without being
explicitly programmed, to carry out complex tasks quickly and efficiently.
Facebook uses machine learning to generate the estimated action rate and the ad
quality score used in the total value equation.

### Estimated Action Rate

To find the estimated action rate, machine learning models predict a particular
person's likelihood of taking the advertiser's desired action, based on the
business objective the advertiser selects for their ad, like increasing visits
to their website or driving purchases.

To do this, our models consider:

- That person's behavior on and off Facebook
- The content of the ad
- The time of day
- Interactions between people and ads

#### Behaviors on Facebook

Examples of behaviors on Facebook that the models consider include things a
person does while using Facebook apps, like:

- Clicking on an ad
- Liking a post

#### Behaviors off Facebook

Examples of behaviors off Facebook that the models consider include things a
person does outside of Facebook that businesses share with us via our Business
Tools, like:

- Visiting a website
- Purchasing a product
- Installing an app

### Ad Quality Score

To generate an ad's quality score, our machine learning models consider:

- The feedback of people viewing or hiding the ad
- Assessments of low-quality attributes:
  - Too much text in the ad's image
  - Sensationalized language
  - Engagement bait

The advertiser's bid, the estimated action rate and the ad quality score are
combined to calculate the ad's total value score in the ad auction.

## How does machine learning improve ad delivery?

Over time, as more people view an ad, share feedback on it or click through to
make a purchase on an advertiser's website, our models get better at predicting
the estimated action rate and ad quality.

### Key Benefits

- Billions of people use our apps and engage with ads each day
- Our system gets lots of information to help improve its calculations
- Furthers our ultimate goal of maximizing value for both people and businesses

**Important Note:** Ads with the highest bid don't always win the auction. Ads
with lower bids often win if our system predicts a person is more likely to
respond to them, or finds that they're higher quality. This allows businesses of
all sizes to compete in the auction and reach customers on any budget.

## What controls are available to people to help determine what ads they see?

### Ad Preferences

The Ad Preferences page is a place for users to review and update their ad
settings so they can take more control over what information we use when
deciding what ads to show them. People can opt out of seeing ads based on data
from partners, and can also hide or report any ad from any advertiser with a few
taps.

**Action:** Manage your ad preferences

### Why Am I Seeing This?

Why Am I Seeing This shows users information about the detailed targeting
options the advertiser chose to reach them. It lets them tap on posts and ads in
News Feed, get context on why they're appearing and take action to further
personalize what they see.

### Off-Facebook Activity

Some businesses send us information about users' activity on their sites and we
use that information to show them ads that are relevant to them. Off-Facebook
Activity lets users see a summary of that information and clear it from their
account if they want to.

## What are common misunderstandings about Facebook Ads?

- **Facebook does not sell people's data** to advertisers or anyone else
- **We don't share information with advertisers** that personally identifies
  individuals unless they've given us permission
- **Facebook does not use the content of people's text messages or phones'
  microphone** to inform ads or to change what they see in News Feed

## Summary

At Facebook, our goal is to create personalized, data-driven ad experiences that
are interesting and useful for people and effective for businesses. When we're
able to show someone the right ad for the right product, it's valuable for
everyone, and value is what good personalized advertising is all about.
