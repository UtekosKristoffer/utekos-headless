# Driving Performance for App and Gaming Advertisers through Improved AI Optimization

## Overview

AI performs better for businesses when it knows exactly what success looks like,
so with that in mind, we're committed to giving app advertisers ways to tell us
what they value and what kind of conversions they want.

App advertisers have a variety of goals they may be looking to achieve with
Meta:

- App downloads
- In-app purchases
- Highest return on ad spend (ROAS) from app users

Every business defines success differently, so our goal is to continue giving
advertisers and agencies tools and controls to help guide our AI tools towards
the results that matter most to their business.

## Focusing on the Most Valuable In-App Purchases

For app advertisers focused on driving in-app purchases, Meta offers two
campaign approaches:

1. **Volume of conversions** - Optimize for quantity
2. **Value of conversions** - Optimize for highest-value conversions

**Example**: A gaming advertiser focused on value might prefer 10 purchases in
their app at $9.99 each over 15 purchases at $1.99 each.

### Performance Improvements in 2025

Throughout 2025, we have continued to enhance our models to make value
optimization, also known as "maximize the value of conversions", even more
performant.

**Key metric**: Today, advertisers focusing on optimizing the value of
conversions in app campaigns see a **29% higher return on ad spend (ROAS)**
compared to those optimizing for volume of conversions, making this the most
performant Meta solution for App advertisers optimizing for ROAS.

## Optimizing Ads through Closer Alignment with Mobile Measurement Partners

### What are MMPs?

Many app advertisers measure campaign effectiveness through **Mobile Measurement
Partners (MMPs)**, third-party companies which show the impact of advertising
across different channels, including Meta.

**Meta's badged partners include**:

- Adjust
- Airbridge
- AppsFlyer
- Branch
- Kochava
- Singular
- Tenjin

We have been working to better align our ads attribution and delivery models
with the reporting advertisers see through these third parties.

### Foundational Model Enhancements

As part of these efforts, we have implemented a range of foundational model
enhancements, collaborating with MMPs, to help optimize our ads system to
deliver more of the conversions advertisers value in their third-party analytics
tools.

#### Understanding Advertiser-Specific Definitions

Advertisers may have distinct definitions for specific categories or events
within their MMP reporting, such as:

- **New user window**: How long after a first app install a user can be
  considered as a 'new user' if they reinstall the app
- **Reengagement window**: How long a user must be inactive in the app before
  they can be attributed to a reengagement campaign

By gaining insight into these varying timeframes, we can more effectively
pinpoint and reach the types of people that each advertiser deems most valuable.

### Updated Exclusion Windows

With this in mind, in certain MMPs, Meta has now updated the window that
advertisers use to determine what counts as a new user that we should target
with our app promotion campaigns:

| MMP                     | Exclusion Window Configuration                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AppsFlyer**           | Flexible reattribution window: 0 to 180 days (matches MMP settings) |
| **Adjust and Singular** | Fixed exclusion window: 180 days (lifetime new user window)         |

### Impact and Results

This has positively impacted advertisers, and after extending the exclusion
window from 90 to 180 days, we saw that **Mobile App Promotion campaigns
targeting new users had an average of 20% less acquired users that did not meet
the advertiser's categorization of a new user**.[^1]

This is one example of how we are optimizing our ads system to align with how
advertisers measure within their MMPs, so that we can more efficiently deliver
the types of conversions a business wants to prioritize.
