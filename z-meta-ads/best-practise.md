About ad delivery
The Meta ad delivery system uses an ad auction and machine learning to determine where, when and to whom we show your ads. These processes work together to maximize value for both people and businesses.

Delivering relevant ads
Each time there's an opportunity to show an ad to someone, an ad auction takes place to determine which ad to show.

Since we want each person to see relevant ads, the ad auction considers predictions of each ad’s relevance for the particular person. This means that ads with higher relevance can win ad auctions at lower costs.

Relevance predictions estimate how likely the person is to consider the ad high quality and take the advertiser’s desired action. You can use ad relevance diagnostics to understand if the ads you ran were relevant to the audience you reached.

Optimizing performance
Since we want each advertiser to meet their goals at the lowest cost, the delivery system uses machine learning to improve each ad’s performance. Performance is optimized to minimize each ad’s cost per optimization event.

Each time an ad is shown, the delivery system’s predictions of relevance become more accurate. As a result, the more an ad is shown, the better the delivery system becomes at determining where, when and who to show the ad to minimize the cost per optimization event. We call the period where the delivery system still has a lot to learn about an ad the learning phase.

If you have multiple ads in your ad set (or across your account), we’ll show the ad that’s most likely to achieve the lowest cost per optimization event for the given person. This means that each of your ads won’t necessarily be delivered the same number of times.

Sometimes, the ad or ad set that gets the most results isn’t the ad set that received the lowest cost per optimization event. That’s because the ad delivery system uses predictions of future performance to determine where to deliver next – not each ad set’s past performance. For this reason, we often recommend using Meta Advantage+ placements (formerly known as automatic placements) and broad audiences to provide the delivery system with more flexibility to find lower cost conversions.


Best practices to potentially reduce cost per result for Meta ads

This feature may not be available to you at this time.
When you create a new campaign, certain choices can lead to a higher cost per result than your previous ad sets, campaigns, or similar ad sets or campaigns.

If we believe you can potentially reduce your cost per result, we may provide recommendations that attempt to help you manage your overall cost more efficiently.

How we predict potential high cost per result for your ads
If we predict that your cost per result may be twice as much as your past ads, ad sets, campaigns or similar ads, ad sets or campaigns, we will provide relevant recommendations before you publish your campaign.

Based on your past performance: We consider ad sets or campaigns you created in the past with the same performance goal that have a lower cost per result than what is estimated for your current ad.
Based on performance of businesses like yours: We consider ad performance and costs for similar advertisers, size and industries.
Note: These recommendations regarding potential performance improvements for your ad sets and campaigns may help to reduce your cost per result, but actual results and cost impacts may vary.

Recommendations to potentially reduce cost per result
To potentially improve cost per result, revisit the following ad set or campaign settings:

Expand your audience: If your audience is too specific it may cost more to reach your relevant audience. Make your audience broader so more people can view your ad. Use the Advantage detailed targeting (previously known as Detailed Targeting Expansion) feature to increase the size of your detailed targeting or lookalike audience.
Update your budget: Your cost per result may increase because your budget is significantly higher than usual. We will leverage your budget in the ad auction to capture as many opportunities for the lowest cost first. We will then move on to more costly opportunities. This may be a temporary or sustained increase; be sure to let your campaign exit the learning phase before making changes.
Consider our optimization tools: Our optimization tools let us calculate in real time and capture the most cost effective opportunities to reach your desired results.
Go to Account Overview to see your opportunity score and review and apply recommendations to help improve performance. Learn about opportunity score.
Note: Opportunity score is not yet available to all ad accounts. The score (including a high score) itself does not reflect your actual or future performance. Actual performance depends on many factors and your opportunity score does not guarantee performance.

Combine campaigns and ad sets. When you combine similar ad sets to broaden your audience, our delivery system can work more efficiently to find opportunities for your budget.
Use Advantage+ placements (or Placements with Advantage+ on). Advantage+ placements lets our system place your ads across all available placements and choose results from the widest range possible. Advantage+ placements are typically the most efficient use of your budget and helps control costs.
Use Advantage+ campaign budget (also known as Campaign budget, or Budget with Advantage+ on) Advantage+ campaign budget manages your campaign budget across ad sets to get you the overall best results. This budget continuously distributes in real time to ad sets with the best opportunities throughout the course of your campaign.


Best practices for Meta ads delivery
Meta’s ads delivery system uses machine learning to optimize ad performance and help minimize your costs. We recommend using these best practices across your ad strategy to help our delivery system work more efficiently and achieve better results.
Budget
Opt into Advantage+ campaign budget. Advantage+ campaign budget (also known as Campaign budget, or Budget with Advantage+ on) automatically manages your campaign budget across ad sets to get you the best overall results. You can set a daily budget or a lifetime budget that spans the course of your campaign.
Learn more about best practices for Advantage+ campaign budget.

Audience
Opt into Advantage+ detailed targeting (or using detailed targeting as a suggestion). Advantage detailed targeting allows our system to reach a broader group of people than defined in your detailed targeting selections. If our system finds better performance opportunities outside your defined audience, detailed targeting expansion allows us to dynamically make updates that reflect where we're seeing better performance and we may expand your audience further to include similar opportunities.
Ad placement
Opt into Advantage+ placements (or Placements with Advantage+ on). Advantage+ placements helps our delivery system increase your ad’s exposure and make the most of your budget, by expanding the different channels your ad can be seen on, allowing it to run on Facebook, Instagram, Audience Network and more, depending on how your settings are configured.
Or manually select at least 6+ placements to give your ads the best chance of reaching a relevant audience.
Use Asset customization for placements to customize your ads for the audience behavior and best practices of each placement and to make sure that your ad can run in as many places as possible.
Creative fatigue
Manage creative fatigue. When an audience sees the same image or video too many times, this can result in creative fatigue. Creative fatigue can lead to lower engagement and negatively impact your results. To avoid creative fatigue, try creating a new ad with a new image or video, expand your audience or try dynamic experiences.
When we believe that your target audience has seen the same ad too many times, you will see Creative limited or Creative fatigue in the Delivery column status for your ad set or ad. We consider all recent exposures of the ad's image or video, including those from other campaigns from your Page.
Optimization
The delivery system needs a minimum amount of data to reliably predict conversion rate and help you optimize for the success metric that is representative of your true business goal, or the next closest proxy.

Consolidate your ad sets. The system needs to achieve around 50 optimized conversion events for each ad set before it can exit the learning phase. Minimize your time and budget spent in the learning phase by consolidating similar content into fewer ad sets.
Turn off ads that aren't delivering. Advertisers are often more efficient when they turn off ads that aren't producing outcomes.
Choose a performance goal that matches to your primary business goal. For example, if you care most about return on ad spend, select Maximize value of conversions in the drop-down menu under Performance Goal.



Best practices for Advantage+ campaign budget
When using Advantage+ campaign budget (also known as Campaign budget, or Budget with Advantage+ on), we recommend the following best practices to boost your campaign effectiveness.

Don’t exceed 70 ad sets per campaign. If you include more than 70 ad sets in your campaign, you’re limited by what edits you can make after you publish. Remember that the more ad sets and ads in a campaign, the longer it may spend in the learning phase.
After your initial setup, add additional ad sets in bulk. Whenever you add a new active ad set to your campaign, it can take about 2 hours for CBO to re-adjust.
Don’t manually pause and unpause your ad sets. CBO reserves and spends your campaign budget on active ad sets, and pausing an ad set removes it from consideration. For example, if your campaign budget spend is for 2 ad sets, pausing one ad set would cause our system to focus on spending the budget entirely on the active ad set. By the time you unpause the other ad set and it starts to run, there might not be any budget left in the campaign.
Use ad set spend limits sparingly, or not at all. The more budget that's locked into specific ad sets, the less flexibility our delivery system has to optimize your campaign budget. Be especially careful if you use a cost or bid control along with ad set spend limits, because too many spend constraints can cause your ad set to deliver less than it should, or not deliver at all. If you have strict budget requirements for each ad set in your campaign, you may want to consider using ad set budgets instead of CBO. Learn more about how to choose between campaign budgets and ad set budgets.
If you adjust campaign settings, input changes in bulk to minimize time spent in the learning phase. If you input changes one at a time, your campaign may have to re-enter the learning phase each time.
Remember that audience size may affect budget distribution. If your audiences are significantly different in size, ad sets with the largest audiences will likely receive the most budget with CBO.
Don’t pause ad sets with low delivery. CBO distributes budget to maximize all available opportunities, and pausing a low delivery ad set today prevents CBO from finding tomorrow’s opportunities. This can ultimately cause an increase in cost per action (CPA) for your active ad sets.
Ensure all ad sets in your campaign can be delivered. If an ad set isn't delivering, it isn't encountering any opportunities for results, and we can't distribute budget to it. Instead of pausing ad sets with low delivery, learn more about how to identify and troubleshoot delivery issues with CBO.
Analyze results at the campaign level, rather than at the ad set level. To understand Advantage+ campaign budget results, pay attention to the total number of optimization events for your campaign and the average cost per optimization event at the campaign level.

Combine ad sets and campaigns in Meta Ads Manager to reduce audience fragmentation

We're gradually introducing recommendations in Account Overview to help combine ad sets.
When eligible, you can get experimentally proven recommendations in opportunity score to help you combine ad sets. Opportunity score is a tool from Meta that helps you identify and prioritize effective campaign recommendations in near real time. Learn about opportunity score.

Note: Opportunity score is not yet available to all ad accounts. The score (including a high score) itself does not reflect your actual or future performance. Actual performance depends on many factors and your opportunity score does not guarantee performance.

Benefits of combining similar ad sets across campaigns
Spend your budget efficiently and optimize performance. When you combine ad sets and campaigns our delivery system can work more efficiently to find more opportunities for your budget. For example, you're trying to find your ideal audience and you have 3 ad sets with the same objective and creative. One ad set's audience is only people interested in dogs, another's audience is people interested in dog toys and the last ad set's audience is people interested in dog collars. Splitting your ad sets across these segments to find the ideal audience could decrease performance because your total audience size is split across multiple ad sets. You could improve performance by combining these ad sets and broadening the audience to include all 3 interests in one ad set.
Minimize time and budget spent in the learning phase. When a campaign starts running, each ad set goes through an initial learning phase. During this time, the delivery system learns to deliver ads effectively. When you run too many ad sets at the same time, each one gets fewer opportunities to learn and therefore fewer results. This means ad sets may spend more time in the learning phase, and you may spend more budget before the delivery system can fully optimize performance. Combining ad sets will help you get the results you need faster, which means you’ll see stable results sooner.
How combining ad sets impacts reporting
Instead of fragmenting audiences for reporting purposes, consider using breakdowns in ads reporting. Breakdowns enable you to see ad performance across more granular segments including demographics like age, gender, age and gender, country, region, Designated Market Area (DMA), Comscore market or business locations. Learn more about breakdowns, metrics, and filtering in Ads Reporting.
You can create an automated rule for us to automatically combine ad sets if audience fragmentation is detected. You can also manage your rules to receive notifications if audience fragmentation is detected.

About managing ad volume

Starting in June 2024, you may no longer be able to use dynamic creative when creating ad sets on Ads Manager when you select sales or app promotion as your objective. While existing campaigns leveraging dynamic creative will be unaffected at this time, using flexible ad format to achieve a similar result is recommended. Learn more about the flexible ad format.
Ad volume and performance
The number of active ads in your ad account or from your Page plays an important role in achieving predictable, stable and optimized results.

Each time an ad is shown, our ads delivery system learns more about the best people and places to show the ad. The more an ad is shown, the better the delivery system becomes at optimizing the ad’s performance.

When an advertiser runs too many ads at once, each ad delivers less often. This means that fewer ads exit the learning phase, and more budget is spent before the delivery system can optimize performance. In other words, too many ads can result in worse performance.

To achieve more predictable, stable and optimized results, advertisers should monitor active ad volume and ensure they do not exceed the limit per Page on ads that are running or in review. Learn more about ad limits.

Testing new creative and marketing strategies is still important. However, advertisers should balance these tactics with ensuring that the delivery system has ample opportunity to learn about each ad.

Best practices
The below tactics can help you to manage ad volume.

1. Combine ad sets. Combining ad sets will help you get the conversions you need to exit learning phase sooner.

If reporting on results for each audience, combine ad sets and use breakdowns for granular reporting that doesn’t sacrifice performance.
If targeting small geographic areas, combine ad sets into larger geographical areas to aggregate conversions and delivery learnings across ad sets.
If creating different ad sets for different placements, combine ad sets and use Meta Advantage+ placements (formerly known as automatic placements) and asset customization. Asset customization enables you to choose the ideal assets for each placement for a single ad.
If creating different ad sets for different languages, combine ad sets and set multiple languages in a single ad set. If you are using Meta Advantage+ catalog ads, you can create a Advantage+ catalog ad for multiple languages and countries by adding a language and/or country feed to your catalog.
2. Decrease ads per ad set. Testing creative is essential for improving performance over time, but you should do so in ways that are replicable and more effective.

If testing multiple text variants, use multiple text optimization. One ad with multiple text optimization is usually more effective than multiple ads without multiple text optimization, because it enables the delivery system to automatically optimize for the performance of each ad impression.
If testing multiple creative variants, use dynamic creative. This lets our delivery system find the best creative to deliver for a given user – all while using just one ad.
If testing multiple formats, use Advantage+ creative for catalog. Advantage+ creative for catalog helps you show people different ad formats and creative based on what they're most likely to respond to.
3. Use industry-specific solutions. Meta offers many solutions to meet industry-specific needs for high ad volume. With these solutions, you can use fewer ads while still promoting your whole product catalog.

If your aim is to raise awareness of several physical stores, use store location features to customize ads with local information and creative for each of your stores.
If advertising many products to the same audience, use Advantage+ catalog ads. Advantage+ catalog ads enable the delivery system to automatically optimize the best products to show to each person.
If advertising many real estate properties, combine ad sets then use real estate ads to show ads to people the properties their most likely to buy.
If advertising automotive inventory, use automotive inventory ads to promote your entire inventory of vehicles with fewer ads.
4. Turn off ads that aren’t delivering. Advertisers are often more efficient in Meta Ads Manager when they turn off ads that aren’t producing outcomes.

Turn off ads that aren’t receiving impressions. Active ads that haven’t delivered in a few days are less likely to win auctions in the future.
Turn off ads that aren’t performing well. Use Ads Manager filters to find and turn off your worst-performing ads (such as those with the highest cost per result).
Turn off ads that are learning limited. Ads that are Learning Limited aren’t generating enough results to exit the learning phase. If you can’t fix the issue, it is often best to turn off the ad.

You can create an automated rule for us to automatically combine ad sets if audience fragmentation is detected. You can also manage your rules to receive notifications if audience fragmentation is detected.

About performance goals
When you choose a performance goal for an ad set, you're telling the ad delivery system to get you that result as efficiently as possible. In other words, your performance goal is the desired outcome that our system bids on in the ad auction. For example, if you choose Maximize number of link clicks, your ads will be targeted to people in your audience who are most likely to click the links on your ads.

Based on the performance goal you choose, the ad delivery system uses machine learning to improve your ad performance. The performance goal of your ad set can be different from your ad objective. For example, you can select Sales as your ad objective, but optimize for link clicks within an ad set.

Note: You may need to set up a Meta Pixel or SDK to use some performance goals, such as value. These tools allow you to pass back web or app event data to Meta technologies.

Types of performance goals
Some performance goals are only available when you select a specific ad objective and conversion location, while other performance goals are available to more than one ad objective. Learn more about what performance goals are available by ad objective and conversion location in Meta Ads Manager. Below is a list of performance goals available within each objective and what actions they each optimize for:


Maximize number of conversions: Show your ads to people most likely to take a specific action on your website.
Maximize value of conversions: Show your ads to people most likely to make higher value purchases.
Maximize number of landing page views: Show your ads to people most likely to view the website linked in your ad.
Maximize number of link clicks: Show your ads to people most likely to click on them.
Maximize daily unique reach: Show your ads to people up to once per day.
Maximize number of impressions: Show your ads to people as many times as possible.
Maximize number of conversations: Show your ads to people most likely to have a conversation with you through messaging.
Maximize number of calls: Show your ads to people most likely to call you.
Maximize number of app events: Show your ads to people most likely to take a specific action in your app at least once.

How performance goals can affect your budget and bid strategy
Remember that some performance goals may require more budget than others. For example, a conversion may cost more than a landing page view. So, it’s important to ensure the following when selecting your budget and bid strategy:

Your budget is large enough to accommodate the cost of your chosen performance goal: In general, your daily budget should be at least 10 times the average cost of your performance goal. For example, if you want to optimize for link clicks and your average cost per link click is $5, your daily budget should be at least $50.
You’ve set your bid cap or cost per result goal high enough to achieve your chosen performance goal: Your bid cap is the maximum amount you’re willing to bid to win in auctions and get the result you’re optimizing for. Your cost per result goal is the average amount you want to pay for your optimization event. Learn more about bid strategies.

Best practices to make your ad more engaging
Engaging and creative ads don't require expensive equipment or lots of time. Here are tips to improve the effectiveness of your creative:


Example of an ad delivered to Instagram Stories

Use vertical videos: Use a vertical or square aspect ratio. Most people hold their phones vertically, so you'll cover more of their screen.
Shorten text: People on Facebook and Instagram scan quickly. Keep your text short, clear and concise to get your message across.
Add multiple images using the carousel format: Carousel allows you to show several images for people to scroll through at the same cost. It's a great opportunity if you have lots of product or brand images. Get carousel tips.
Add movement: Ads with movement can stand out in Feed. Templates in Meta Ads Manager can help you create a video ad from your images. Learn how to create engaging reels.
Use calls to action: A range of call-to-action (CTA) buttons are available for Facebook and Instagram ads. These buttons draw attention and encourage people to engage with your ad. Based on what you want people to do when they see your ad, experiment with the CTA buttons available for different ad objectives and formats. See which ones get your audience to take action.


Best practices for carousel ads
The carousel format displays 2 or more images or videos in a single ad, each with its own headline, description, link and call to action. To scroll through a carousel, people swipe on their mobile device or click the arrows on their computer screen.

When you create a carousel ad in Meta Ads Manager, follow these best practices to help reach more people and increase conversion rates.

Tell your story with all the available carousel components. Images and videos grab attention, but you can also use headlines, descriptions and call to action buttons that give context, detail and encouragement. You can include up to 10 cards in each carousel ad.


Use images or videos that are cohesive and engaging. Take images or videos from the same shoot or that feel similar to each other. When you use videos in your carousel ad, we recommend the square (1:1) aspect ratio for each video. When creating a dynamic carousel ad with product images from catalog, either 1:1 or 4:5 aspect ratio can be displayed.
Note: The 4:5 aspect ratio is only available for Advantage+ catalog ads that are created using the carousel format and with product images from your catalog.Learn more about the product image specification for catalogs and the supported aspect ratios.
Use a large product set. If you choose to use a product set from your catalog for your carousel ad, we recommend that you select a fairly broad set. To display in your ad, items must be in stock, not rejected and not variants of the same product. If the number of available items in the set ever falls to less than 2, your carousel ad turns into a single image ad or stops running.
Provide a variety of links. If you want to promote multiple products or services, provide a link to the product that is featured in each carousel card. For example, include a link to your blouses in a carousel card with a blouse, and a link to your shoes in a carousel card with shoes. Note that you can promote external links, Facebook Pages, Facebook events and Facebook offers within your carousel ad.
Choose images based on your goal. Use product imagery to reach people who have visited product pages on your website. Use lifestyle imagery to reach prospective customers.
Try carousel optimizations. In Ads Manager, you may see these options to choose from: Automatically show the best performing cards first, Display carousel cards as a video, Add a card at the end with your Page profile picture, Add music and Add a map card showing your nearest stores.
Pair with the perfect landing page. If you're a large business with a large inventory, take people who click on a carousel card to specific product pages. If you're a smaller business with a smaller inventory, take people who click on a carousel card to the page with all your products in that category. For example, if a carousel card features a women's blouse, you could send people to a page that showcases all the women's blouses you sell.

Best practices for landing page view performance goals
Setting performance goals for landing page views is a way to improve the quality of the traffic your site receives because of your ads.

If your goal is to get more traffic on specific pages of your website: We recommend landing page view optimization over link click optimization, since the former can improve traffic quality.
If your goal is to get more conversions: We recommend trying to optimize for conversions first. However, maximize number of conversions does not work for everyone. A conversion-optimized ad set needs to get about 50 or more of the conversion it's optimized for per week to have a chance at being effective. If your ad set doesn't get that many conversions per week, landing page view optimization could be an effective alternative. It’s also a good choice if you don't have lower-funnel events (such as purchase conversions) set up yet with your Meta Pixel.
If you're using an ad format (such as Offers or Messenger) that takes people to a Facebook Page or video: We recommend setting a performance goal for Maximize number of Facebook Page visits, not landing page views.
When eligible, you can get experimentally proven landing page view recommendations in opportunity score. Opportunity score is a tool from Meta that helps you identify and prioritize effective campaign recommendations in near real time. Learn about opportunity score.

Note: Opportunity score is not yet available to all ad accounts. The score (including a high score) itself does not reflect your actual or future performance. Actual performance depends on many factors and your opportunity score does not guarantee performance.



Best practices to improve ad quality and performance
At Meta, we prioritize analyzing ads to detect any violations to our low quality or disruptive content advertising policy. Below is information on how best adhere to our best practices for improved ad quality and performance. Learn more about our advertising policies in our Transparency Center.

How Meta analyzes ad quality
Meta conducts research and analyzes feedback from our community to understand which attributes of ads are low-quality, diminishing value for people and businesses.

If advertisers repeatedly post policy violating or low-quality ads, our system may associate their Page, domain, ad account or other associated entities as lower-quality, making ads created from these entities less competitive in auctions.

That means it will cost more and advertisers will see fewer results than if the ads did not contain these attributes and associations. Advertisers can maximize ad performance by understanding and avoiding the following attributes.

Below are some of the key low-quality attributes of ad content and post-click experiences. If an ad contains any of these attributes, the ad quality component of an ad’s total value may be relatively low.

Attributes of low-quality ad content
Withholding information: Ads that withhold information in order to entice someone to click a link to understand the full context of something.
Examples of clickbait ads

Sensationalized language: Includes using exaggerated headlines or commanding a reaction from people to a degree that creates an unexpected experience when people click to a landing page. For additional tips on removing this and other forms of clickbait, see our publishing best practices.
Examples of sensationalized ad language

Engagement bait: When an ad uses spammy content that urges people to engage with it in an inauthentic way to get more likes, comments and shares.
Illustrations of engagement bait in ads

As a reminder, if we detect that an ad violates our low quality or disruptive content advertising policy, we'll reject it.

Note: Account Quality is now Business Support Home

How we measure ad quality
To measure ad quality, we monitor for certain actions and signals that people may take or provide when engaging with an ad. These include:

Hide ad
Hide all ads from this advertiser
Hide all ads from this advertiser
Hide ad due to repetition
Report ad
Landing page bounce rate
Landing page dwell time
Note: If we detect that an ad violates our low quality or disruptive content advertising policy, we'll reject it.

Attributes of a low-quality ad landing page experience
Lack substantive or original content
Disproportionate volume of ads relative to content
Pop-up ads or interstitial ads: this includes any ads that disrupt the user experience–it doesn't include legally required disclosures or logins to private content, like paywalls
Unexpected content experiences: this includes, for example, spreading an article's content across multiple pages and requiring someone to click and/or load multiple pages to read through the full article
Misleading experiences: this includes websites that misrepresent products, expected shipping times, customer support experiences and associated feedback from customers such as being dissatisfied with advertising
Advertisers are expected to understand and comply with all relevant policies. As a reminder, regardless of low-quality attributes, all ads and landing pages must abide by our Community Standards and Advertising Standards, including adult content, non-functional landing page, low quality or disruptive content, sensational content, commercial exploitation of crises and controversial events, and unrealistic outcomes.

Best practices for cost-effective ad creative on Meta technologies
You don't need a large budget or professional training to make creative Meta ads (i.e. ads on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta technologies) that draw attention. Many large and small advertisers are finding success with simple, eye-catching creative.

If you think your image ads could be more effective, try these tips for creating ads with a single point of focus. Small changes can increase your chances of grabbing people's attention.

If video production is too expensive, try carousel ads. The carousel format lets you show 2 or more images and/or videos, headlines and links or calls to action in a single ad. People scroll through the carousel cards by swiping on mobile phones or tablets or clicking arrows on a computer screen.

If you don't have much equipment, use your phone. Mobile studio shares inspiration, app suggestions and ideas from advertisers who make captivating ads with their phones.

Creative platform partners are third-party businesses that work with Meta to help you create or improve your video ads. This is a cost-effective way to trim longer videos.

If you want to add movement, try GIFs, cinemagraphs and boomerangs to grab attention in Feed.

If you have stale content, rejuvenate it with apps. Create compelling short ads with images you already have, text and licensed music overlays with apps like Ripl and Videoshop.

Use automated captions to engage people who browse Facebook Feed with sound off. Add motion to copy using the Legend app.

If you want to build better mobile video ads, try Meta Creative Hub. Creative Hub allows your team to mock up ad designs together. You can experiment with different formats and placements. You can also preview ads as they'll appear on mobile devices within Feed, which helps prevent display issues.

Best practices for minimum budgets

This article uses US dollars when referencing minimum budget requirements. Minimum budgets may vary by country and objective.
When you create a campaign or ad set, we require a minimum budget from you to help us deliver your ads consistently. When determining minimum budget requirements and recommendations, we consider your business vertical, budget type, buying type, bid strategy, optimization, currency and schedule in order to avoid under-delivery.

Note: You should see an alert in Meta Ads Manager if your budget doesn’t meet our minimum requirements. You may see a recommendation in Ads Manager if your budget meets the minimum requirements, but may not be high enough to achieve optimal results.

We recommend the following best practices for minimum budgets:

Allocate enough budget for your chosen optimization event. Some optimization events may require more budget than others, depending on how difficult they are to achieve. For example, if you optimize for purchases, you may need to allocate more budget than if you optimize for landing page views. If you don’t want to increase your budget, you can try optimizing for an event that may be easier and cheaper to achieve. Learn more about optimization.
For ad set budgets, most advertisers should have a large enough daily budget. Minimum budget requirements may be different by location or depending on when you choose to get charged for ads. The requirements for lifetime budgets and Advantage+ campaign budget (also known as Campaign budget, or Budget with Advantage+ on) may also be slightly different depending on your settings. With Advantage+ campaign budget, the risk of under-delivery is lower because budget is allocated freely across all ad sets.
If you use the cost per result goal bid strategy, your daily budget should be at least 5 times the amount of your cost per result goal. For example, if you set a cost per result goal of $5 your daily budget should be at least $25.
If you lower your lifetime budget, keep the new amount equal to or more than how much you’ve spent so far, plus 10% of the amount you’ve spent over the past 2 days. For example, if you’ve spent $300 so far, and $100 of that amount was spent in the past 2 days, your new budget must be at least $310.
Use caution when decreasing your budget near the end of the day. This is because the system may not have enough time to apply new settings. For example, if you decrease your daily budget from $200 to $100 at 5pm, the system may have spent over your new daily budget of $100 already. Or, it may not have enough time to adjust and slow down delivery.
