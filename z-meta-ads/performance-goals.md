# About Performance Goals

When you choose a performance goal for an ad set, you're telling the ad delivery system to get you that result as efficiently as possible. In other words, your performance goal is the desired outcome that our system bids on in the ad auction. For example, if you choose **Maximize number of link clicks**, your ads will be targeted to people in your audience who are most likely to click the links on your ads.

Based on the performance goal you choose, the ad delivery system uses machine learning to improve your ad performance. The performance goal of your ad set can be different from your ad objective. For example, you can select **Sales** as your ad objective, but optimize for link clicks within an ad set.

> **Note:** You may need to set up a Meta Pixel or SDK to use some performance goals, such as value. These tools allow you to pass back web or app event data to Meta technologies.

## How Performance Goals Can Affect Your Budget and Bid Strategy

Remember that some performance goals may require more budget than others. For example, a conversion may cost more than a landing page view. So, it's important to ensure the following when selecting your budget and bid strategy:

- **Your budget is large enough to accommodate the cost of your chosen performance goal:** In general, your daily budget should be at least 10 times the average cost of your performance goal. For example, if you want to optimize for link clicks and your average cost per link click is $5, your daily budget should be at least $50.
- **You've set your bid cap or cost per result goal high enough to achieve your chosen performance goal:** Your bid cap is the maximum amount you're willing to bid to win in auctions and get the result you're optimizing for. Your cost per result goal is the average amount you want to pay for your optimization event. Learn more about [bid strategies](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/bid-strategies).
