# About Reasonably Prominent Notices in Lead Ads with Instant Form

## Overview

When you collect contact information through lead ads with instant form, you
should give people appropriate notice on how their information will be used.
Meta requires you to inform people about why you're collecting their contact
information and how you're going to use or share it with third parties to comply
with our Lead Ads Terms.

## When a Reasonably Prominent Notice May Be Needed

A reasonably prominent notice may be needed in the following instances:

- **Automotive Industry**: A global car manufacturer receives contact
  information through an instant form from people interested in buying a car and
  then shares that contact information with dealerships local to those people.

- **Real Estate**: A real estate company receives contact information through an
  instant form from people interested in buying a home and then shares that
  contact information with realtors in locations near those people.

- **Event Planning**: A wedding planner receives contact information through an
  instant form from engaged couples interested in planning a wedding and then
  shares that information with local partners including DJs, caterers and
  florists.

## Implementation

You can create a reasonably prominent notice while creating an instant form, and
it will be shared with people before they submit the form.
