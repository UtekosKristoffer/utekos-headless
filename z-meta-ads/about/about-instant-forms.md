# About Instant Form Types

When you create a new campaign with leads as your ad objective in Meta Ads
Manager, you can select instant forms as your conversion location. Lead ads with
instant form are designed to help you generate and qualify leads by asking
people to fill out a form.

## Types of Instant Forms

There are different types of instant forms to help you achieve your business
goals:

- **More volume (default)**: Makes it easy for people to quickly submit the form
  on a mobile device, as this option is designed to generate a larger number of
  leads.
- **Higher intent**: Focuses on securing very intentional leads for people who
  may be interested in a specific product or service, such as booking a test
  drive at a dealership.
- **Rich creative**: Creates a more flexible and personalized instant form to
  focus on your target audience.

To change the default option from More volume, choose the Higher intent or Rich
creative option in the Form type section when you create an instant form.

## Higher Intent Instant Forms

### Distinct Features

- Inline context under contact fields to indicate that your business may follow
  up.
- A review screen that gives people a chance to confirm their information.
- A slide to submit button in the review screen.

These features help you receive more intentional submissions and prevent
receiving submissions from those people who are only marginally interested in
your product or service. If follow-up or further qualification is required on
each lead submitted, using a higher intent instant form may make more sense for
your business.

> **Note**: A higher intent instant form will only be delivered to Facebook Feed
> and Instagram feed on mobile devices. It will not appear on desktop computers.

## Rich Creative Forms

### Distinct Features

- Modify the color scheme to better match your brand identity.
- Select and include images that are relevant to your cause.
- Add additional text, such as product descriptions and promotions, to help
  provide more context to your form.

These features help you provide more context about your business or service,
infuse more of the brand personality into the form and potentially increase lead
quality.
