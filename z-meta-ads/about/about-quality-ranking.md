About quality ranking

Starting in June 2024, you may no longer be able to use dynamic creative when creating ad sets on Ads Manager when you select sales or app promotion as your objective. While existing campaigns leveraging dynamic creative will be unaffected at this time, using flexible ad format to achieve a similar result is recommended. Learn more about the flexible ad format.
Ad relevance diagnostics help you diagnose underperforming ads across 3 dimensions of relevance: quality, engagement and conversion. Reviewing the diagnostics together gives you more insights than reviewing each diagnostic individually.

Quality ranking explains how your ad's perceived quality compared to ads competing for the same audience. We measure ad quality through various signals, such feedback from people viewing or hiding the ad and assessments of low-quality attributes in the ad, such as withholding information, sensationalized language and engagement bait.

Possible values for quality ranking are (where average represents the 35th to 55th percentile):

Above average
Average
Below average (bottom 35% of ads)
Below average (bottom 20% of ads)
Below average (bottom 10% of ads)
Quality ranking isn't available for dynamic creative. This metric is only available for the last 35 days.

For example, a quality ranking of Below average (bottom 20% of ads) means that your ad's perceived quality was among the lowest 20% of ads competing for the same audience. At least 80% of ads competing for the same audience were perceived as higher quality.
