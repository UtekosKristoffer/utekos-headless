# Meta Pixel Implementation Guide

## Get Started

The Meta Pixel is a snippet of JavaScript code that loads a small library of
functions you can use to track Facebook ad-driven visitor activity on your
website. It relies on Facebook cookies, which enable us to match your website
visitors to their respective Facebook User accounts. Once matched, we can tally
their actions in the Facebook Ads Manager so you can use the data to analyze
your website's conversion flows and optimize your ad campaigns.

### Default Tracking Capabilities

By default, the Pixel will track:

- URLs visited
- Domains visited
- The devices your visitors use

### Additional Capabilities

In addition, you can use the Pixel's library of functions to:

- Track conversions, so you can measure ad effectiveness
- Define custom audiences, so you can target visitors who are more likely to
  convert
- Set up Advantage+ catalog ads campaigns

## Requirements

In order to implement the Pixel, you will need:

- Access to your website's code base
- Your Pixel's base code or its ID
- Access to the Facebook Ads Manager

**Note:** Depending on where you conduct business, you may have to comply with
General Data Protection Regulation.

## Base Code

Before you can install the Pixel, you will need your Pixel's base code, which
you can find in the **Ads Manager > Events Manager**. If you have not created a
Pixel, follow these instructions to create one â€” all you will need is the
Pixel's base code (step 1).

### Base Code Structure

The base Pixel code contains your Pixel's ID in two places and looks like this:

```html
<!-- Facebook Pixel Code -->
<script>
  !(function (f, b, e, v, n, t, s) {
    if (f.fbq) return
    n = f.fbq = function () {
      n.callMethod ? n.callMethod.apply(n, arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments)
    }
    if (!f._fbq) f._fbq = n
    n.push = n
    n.loaded = !0
    n.version = '2.0'
    n.queue = []
    t = b.createElement(e)
    t.async = !0
    t.src = v
    s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s)
  })(
    window,
    document,
    'script',
    'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js'
  )
  fbq('init', '{your-pixel-id-goes-here}')
  fbq('track', 'PageView')
</script>
<noscript>
  <img
    height="1"
    width="1"
    style="display:none"
    src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id={your-pixel-id-goes-here}&ev=PageView&noscript=1"
  />
</noscript>
<!-- End Facebook Pixel Code -->
```

### What the Base Code Does

When run, this code will:

1. Download a library of functions which you can then use for conversion
   tracking
2. Automatically track a single PageView conversion by calling the `fbq()`
   function each time it loads

**Recommendation:** We recommend that you leave this function call intact.

## Installing The Pixel

### Recommended Installation Method

To install the Pixel, we highly recommend that you add its base code between the
opening and closing `<head>` tags on every page where you will be tracking
website visitor actions. Most developers add it to their website's persistent
header, so it can be used on all pages.

### Why Place in `<head>` Tags?

Placing the code within your `<head>` tags:

- Reduces the chances of browsers or third-party code blocking the Pixel's
  execution
- Executes the code sooner, increasing the chance that your visitors are tracked
  before they leave your page

### Verification Steps

Once you have added it to your website:

1. Load a page that has the Pixel
2. This should call `fbq('track', 'PageView')`, which will be tracked as a
   PageView event in the Events Manager
3. Verify that this event was tracked by going to your Events Manager
4. Locate your Pixel and click its details
5. If you see a new PageView event, you have successfully installed the Pixel
6. If you do not see it, wait a few minutes and refresh the page
7. If your Pixel is still not working, use the Pixel Helper to track down the
   problem

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Installing Using a Tag Manager

Although we recommend adding the Pixel directly to your website's `<head>` tags,
the Pixel will work in most tag management and tag container solutions. For
specific advice on implementing the Pixel using your tag manager, please refer
to your tag manager's documentation.

### Installing Using an IMG Tag

Although not recommended, you can alternately install the Pixel using an `<img>`
tag.

### Mobile Websites

If your mobile website is separate from your desktop website, we recommend that
you add the Pixel to both. This will allow you to easily:

- Remarket to your mobile visitors
- Exclude them
- Create lookalike audiences

## Pixel Helper

We highly recommend that you install our **Pixel Helper Chrome extension**. The
Pixel Helper provides extremely valuable feedback that can help you verify that
your Pixel is working correctly, especially when you start tracking conversions,
where you can easily encounter formatting errors.

---

## Next Steps

Once you have verified that the Pixel is installed and tracking the PageView
event correctly, you can use the Pixel to:

- Track conversions
- Create custom audiences
- Set up Advantage+ catalog ads
