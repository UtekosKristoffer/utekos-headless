# **Bridging the Knowledge Gap: A Deep-Dive Analysis of the Q4 2025 Web Development and API Landscape for the utekos.no Stack**

## **Introduction**

This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the significant updates
and architectural shifts within the core technologies comprising the utekos.no
stack, as of October 31, 2025. The primary objective is to delineate the precise
knowledge gap between the capabilities understood by foundational large language
models, such as Gemini Pro 2.5, and the current production versions of Next.js
16.0.1, React 19.2, Meta Graph API v24, and Shopify API 2025-10. By articulating
the specific new features, breaking changes, and alterations in programming
logic, this document serves as a foundational resource. It is designed to
empower the development team to create precise internal documentation, thereby
optimizing AI-assisted development workflows through more accurate,
context-aware prompting and collaboration. The analysis prioritizes the tightly
integrated Next.js and React frameworks, followed by an in-depth review of
Meta's conversion tracking APIs and their complex implementation in a headless
architecture, concluding with relevant updates to the Shopify platform.

## **Part 1: The Core Framework Evolution: Next.js 16 and React 19.2**

The release of Next.js 16 and its tight integration with React 19.2 represent a
significant maturation of the App Router paradigm. These updates are not merely
incremental; they introduce fundamental architectural changes aimed at
maximizing performance out-of-the-box, enhancing the developer experience by
reducing boilerplate, and providing more explicit, granular control over the
application's rendering and caching lifecycle. The following sections provide an
exhaustive analysis of these transformative changes.

### **1.1 The New Performance Architecture: Turbopack and the React Compiler**

The most impactful changes in this release cycle are the architectural decisions
to stabilize and promote two key pieces of the toolchain: Turbopack as the
default bundler and the React Compiler as a stable, opt-in feature. This
strategic consolidation of the development toolchain creates a highly optimized,
"zero-config" performance layer that abstracts away complex tooling decisions,
allowing developers to focus on application logic.

#### **1.1.1 Turbopack's Ascension to Default Bundler**

Next.js 16 marks the culmination of a long development cycle by promoting
Turbopack, the Rust-based bundler, to stable status and making it the default
for all applications.1 This decision reflects Vercel's confidence in its
stability for production workloads and its profound impact on developer
productivity.

The performance gains are substantial and require no initial configuration.
Developers can expect production builds (`next build`) to be between 2 to 5
times faster and local development's Fast Refresh to be up to 10 times faster
compared to the previous Webpack-based infrastructure.1 This acceleration
directly translates to shorter deployment pipelines and a more fluid,
instantaneous feedback loop during development.

The core logic for developers has been inverted. Previously, opting into
Turbopack required the `--turbopack` flag. Now, this is the default behavior.
For projects that rely on custom Webpack configurations, developers must
explicitly opt out by using the `--webpack` flag for both development and
production builds (e.g., `next dev --webpack`, `next build --webpack`).1

Further enhancing this performance story is the introduction of Turbopack File
System Caching, currently in beta.2 This feature is designed to persist
compilation caches between development server restarts, leading to even faster
startup and compile times on subsequent runs. This can be enabled via the
`turbopackFileSystemCache` option in `next.config.js`.6

#### **1.1.2 React Compiler Integration: The End of Manual Memoization**

A parallel and equally significant development is the stable integration of the
React Compiler into Next.js 16.2 While not enabled by default, it can be
activated with a simple configuration change in `next.config.js`:
`reactCompiler: true`.5 The compiler's purpose is to automate the memoization of
React components and hooks, a task that has historically been a major source of
cognitive overhead and code verbosity for developers.

This addresses a long-standing developer pain point: the manual and often
error-prone application of `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`.7 These
hooks, while powerful, clutter component logic and require careful management of
dependency arrays to prevent bugs. The React Compiler analyzes component code
and automatically applies these optimizations where necessary, without developer
intervention.

The fundamental logic for writing performant components is therefore
transformed. The paradigm shifts from an imperative optimization model, where
the developer explicitly tells React what to memoize, to a declarative authoring
model. Developers are encouraged to write straightforward, "vanilla" React code,
trusting the compiler to handle the performance optimizations.7 This not only
reduces boilerplate by 40-50% in some cases but also leads to code that is
significantly cleaner, more readable, and less prone to bugs related to stale
closures or incorrect dependency arrays.10 Adopting the compiler requires a
conscious effort to "unlearn" old habits of premature or excessive memoization.

### **1.2 A Paradigm Shift in Rendering: From Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR) to Cache Components**

Next.js 16 moves beyond the initial experiments with Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)
and introduces a more mature, explicit, and granular programming model called
Cache Components. This evolution represents a fundamental shift from implicit,
route-based caching strategies (like `getStaticProps` with `revalidate`) to an
explicit, component-tree-based model. This decoupling of data freshness from the
routing structure enables more flexible and composable application
architectures, which is particularly beneficial for complex e-commerce sites
like utekos.no. A single piece of data, such as product inventory, can be tagged
and updated atomically across the entire site—homepage, category pages, and
product details—without needing to revalidate each page path individually.

#### **1.2.1 The Evolution of PPR**

The previous `experimental.ppr = true` flag has been removed.1 This flag was a
powerful but blunt, application-wide instrument. The underlying goal—mixing a
static HTML shell with dynamic, streamed content—is now realized through the
more refined Cache Components model. This new model offers the same performance
benefits but with explicit, fine-grained developer control.

Migration from the old system requires replacing the `experimental.ppr` flag
with the new `experimental.cacheComponents` configuration option in
`next.config.js`.1 The core primitive for opting into this behavior is the
`use cache` directive. By placing `'use cache';` at the top of a component file,
that component and its entire subtree are opted into the new caching and
rendering model, making caching an explicit, opt-in feature rather than an
implicit default.4

#### **1.2.2 New and Refined Caching APIs**

To support the Cache Components model, Next.js 16 introduces new caching
functions and modifies existing ones to provide more explicit control over cache
invalidation and data consistency.

The signature for `revalidateTag()` has been changed. It now requires a
`cacheLife` profile as a second argument (e.g., `revalidateTag(tag, profile)`).1
The previous single-argument version was ambiguous. The new signature clarifies
the developer's intent, enabling specific behaviors like Stale-While-Revalidate
(SWR). For example, a call to `revalidateTag('products', 'max')` would
revalidate the tagged data with a maximum cache lifetime profile.3

Furthermore, a new function, `updateTag()`, has been introduced specifically for
use within Server Actions.2 This function is designed to provide
"read-your-writes" consistency, a critical pattern for data mutations like form
submissions. While `revalidateTag` schedules a revalidation for the future,
`updateTag` ensures that any subsequent reads of the tagged data within the same
request will see the updated value, preventing users from seeing stale data
immediately after an action.

Finally, a new `refresh()` function provides a mechanism to trigger a full
refresh of the current route, re-running server components and data fetches.

### **1.3 Advanced State and Lifecycle Management in React 19.2**

React 19.2 introduces powerful new primitives that provide architectural
solutions to common, complex UI development challenges. Features like the
`<Activity>` component and the `useEffectEvent` hook are not just incremental
additions; they are tools that allow developers to express their _intent_ more
clearly—"this UI is hidden but its state should be preserved"; "this function is
an event that should not trigger an effect's lifecycle"—rather than wrestling
with the low-level mechanics of rendering. This raising of the abstraction level
allows developers to build applications that are both more performant and more
correct by default.

#### **1.3.1 The `<Activity>` Component: A New UI Architecture Primitive**

The new `<Activity>` component provides a mechanism to partition an application
into distinct sections whose visibility and rendering priority can be managed
without unmounting and losing component state.8 In its initial release, it
supports two modes: `visible` and `hidden`.13

When a component tree is wrapped in `<Activity mode="hidden">`, three things
happen:

1. The children are visually hidden, functionally equivalent to
   `display: none`.15
2. All of their effects are unmounted, preventing them from consuming resources
   (e.g., active subscriptions, timers) while off-screen.12
3. Crucially, the component state is preserved. Any updates to this state are
   deferred and processed at a lower priority, when React has idle time.13

When the mode is switched back to `visible`, the UI is revealed with its state
intact, and its effects are re-mounted.15

This is a game-changing feature for common UI patterns. For an e-commerce site
like utekos.no, it can be used to manage tabs on a product page, complex
multi-step forms, or side panels. By wrapping each view in an `<Activity>`
component, switching between them becomes instantaneous because the state (such
as form inputs or scroll position) is not lost and re-created on every toggle.8
It also enables powerful pre-rendering strategies, where a likely next view can
be rendered in the background in a hidden state, making the subsequent
navigation feel immediate to the user.9

#### **1.3.2 The useEffectEvent Hook: Decoupling Events from Effects**

The `useEffectEvent` hook is a long-awaited solution to a core, persistent
problem with the `useEffect` hook's dependency array.4 Previously, if an effect
needed to call a function that relied on frequently changing props or state
(e.g., an analytics tracking event that uses the current theme), that prop or
state variable had to be included in the dependency array. This would cause the
entire effect to tear down and re-run on every change, which is inefficient and
often buggy, especially if the effect manages connections like WebSockets or
event listeners.15 The common but unsafe workaround was to disable the ESLint
rule for the dependency array.9

`useEffectEvent` elegantly solves this by allowing developers to extract
event-like logic into a stable callback.

```js
// Logic Change Example
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  // `onMessage` is an "event" that depends on `theme`, which changes often.
  const onMessage = useEffectEvent(message => {
    showNotification(message.text, theme)
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('message', onMessage)
    connection.connect()
    return () => connection.disconnect()
    // The effect now only re-runs when `roomId` changes.
    // `onMessage` is stable and does not need to be in the array.
  }, [roomId])
}
```

The function wrapped in `useEffectEvent` always has access to the latest props
and state from within the effect's scope, but its own identity remains stable
across re-renders.13 Therefore, it does not need to be included in the
`useEffect` dependency array. The updated `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (version
6.1.1 or higher) will enforce this new pattern, flagging `useEffectEvent`
functions that are incorrectly placed in a dependency array.13

### **1.4 Modernizing Server-Side Interactions and Data Flow**

React 19.2 also introduces low-level primitives that formalize and enhance
server-side rendering and resource management, providing the foundation upon
which frameworks like Next.js build their advanced features.

#### **1.4.1 React's Partial Pre-rendering APIs**

The technology underpinning Next.js's Cache Components is a new set of APIs in
`react-dom` for "Partial Pre-rendering".12 This capability allows an application
to be rendered in two stages.

First, the `prerender` API is called on the server. It generates two outputs: a
static HTML prelude and a postponed state object.14 The prelude is the static
shell of the application that can be sent immediately to the client or a CDN for
an ultra-fast first paint. The postponed state encapsulates the remaining work
required to render the dynamic parts of the application.

Later, the `resume` API can be used, taking the postponed state as input to
continue the rendering process on the server, streaming the dynamic content to
fill in the shell.12 This provides a standardized, low-level mechanism for
frameworks to implement the powerful pattern of serving a static skeleton
instantly while hydrating it with dynamic, user-specific data.

#### **1.4.2 cacheSignal for RSC Resource Management**

For advanced use cases with React Server Components (RSCs), React 19.2
introduces `cacheSignal`.12 When using the `cache()` function to deduplicate
expensive asynchronous operations, `cacheSignal()` provides a signal, similar to
a standard `AbortSignal`, that communicates the lifecycle of the render
associated with that cached data.14

The signal will fire under three conditions: the render completes successfully,
the render is explicitly aborted, or the render fails.12 This allows developers
to gracefully cancel long-running background tasks (e.g., complex database
queries, computations, or third-party API calls) that were initiated within a
`cache()` call if the render that required them is no longer needed. This
prevents wasted server resources and is a crucial tool for building robust,
efficient server-rendered applications.13

### **1.5 Critical Migration Path: Breaking Changes, Deprecations, and New Defaults**

Upgrading to Next.js 16 requires careful attention to a number of breaking
changes, new default behaviors, and deprecations. The following table provides a
consolidated, actionable checklist for migrating a project from Next.js 15.x to
16.0.1.

| Deprecated/Changed Feature    | Technical Impact        | Required Action / Code Replacement                                                                                                                                                                   | Source(s)                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Parallel Routes**           | Build Failure           | All parallel route slots (`@slot`) now require an explicit `default.js` file to define the fallback UI for that slot.                                                                                | Create a `default.js` file within each parallel route directory.                                                                                                             |
| **revalidateTag() Signature** | Caching Behavior Change | The single-argument `revalidateTag(tag)` is deprecated.

## **Part 2: Optimizing Conversion Tracking: Meta Graph & Marketing API v24**

The release of Meta's Graph API and Marketing API v24 introduces significant
changes focused on consolidating ad products, refining targeting capabilities,
and providing advertisers with more automated, algorithmically driven
optimization tools. For a headless e-commerce site like utekos.no, understanding
these changes is crucial for both programmatic ad management and, most
importantly, for implementing a robust and accurate conversion tracking
strategy.

### **2.1 Navigating Programmatic Campaign Management Changes**

The API updates streamline the campaign creation process and alter how budgets
and placements are managed, requiring updates to any automated ad management
scripts.

A major change is the deprecation of Advantage+ shopping campaigns and
Advantage+ app campaigns in v24.17 The API no longer allows the creation,
duplication, or updating of these campaign types. They are being replaced by a
new, unified campaign creation workflow.18 Existing campaigns must be migrated
to this new structure to avoid disruption.

Budgeting has become more flexible and dynamic. The daily budget flexibility has
increased dramatically from 25% to 75%.17 This means Meta's systems can spend up
to 75% _over_ an ad set's specified daily budget on days with high-quality
opportunities. This spend is averaged out over a calendar week
(Sunday-Saturday), ensuring the weekly budget is not exceeded. However,
programmatic budget monitoring systems must be adjusted to account for this much
higher daily variance.

Finally, a new level of placement control has been introduced. Using the new
`placement_soft_opt_out` parameter, advertisers can now allow Meta to allocate
up to 5% of an ad set's budget to placements that have been explicitly
excluded.17 This feature, which works with Sales and Leads objectives, allows
for controlled experimentation on potentially performant placements without
fully committing to them.

### **2.2 The Evolution of Targeting and Audience Management**

API v24 continues the trend of consolidating targeting options and enforcing
stricter data privacy policies.

Meta is combining many granular Detailed Targeting interest options into
broader, more relevant groupings.17 For API v24, calls that attempt to create or
update campaigns using now-deprecated interest options will fail.18 Existing
campaigns using these interests can continue to run until January 15, 2026,
after which their delivery will be stopped unless they are updated with the new,
consolidated options.17 Any scripts or tools used for audience creation must be
updated to reflect this new, smaller set of available interests.

In a significant move for data privacy, Meta is also rolling out new
restrictions that proactively block the use of custom audiences and custom
conversions that contain data suggesting sensitive user attributes, such as
specific health conditions or financial status.19 Campaigns attempting to use
such "flagged" audiences will fail to launch, and existing audiences will stop
receiving new users.17 This requires a thorough audit of all data sources used
for creating custom audiences to ensure compliance.

### **2.3 Advanced CAPI Strategy for Headless Shopify Checkouts**

The most critical area of focus for the utekos.no implementation is the correct
configuration of the Meta Conversions API (CAPI) within its specific headless
architecture. The standard Shopify-Meta integration is designed for a monolithic
Shopify experience and is insufficient on its own to accurately track a user
journey that begins on a separate Next.js frontend. Success hinges on creating a
"stateful transition" for tracking data, ensuring a unique event identifier
persists across the domain boundary from the Next.js application into the
Shopify checkout ecosystem.

#### **2.3.1 The Core Challenge: Cross-Domain Identity**

The user journey for utekos.no starts on the Next.js application and concludes
on Shopify's checkout domain. This creates a fundamental tracking challenge. The
Meta Pixel, operating in the user's browser on utekos.no, exists in a completely
different client-side context from the Shopify checkout pages. Browser security
models, cookie restrictions (ITP, ETP), and ad blockers make it nearly
impossible to reliably connect these two sessions on the client side alone.20
This makes a robust server-side CAPI implementation a non-negotiable requirement
for accurate measurement.

The configured DNS A/AAAA records pointing a subdomain (kasse.utekos.no) to
Shopify's IP address is a valid and recommended strategy for improving user
experience and trust. It presents a consistent domain in the address bar.
However, it does not solve the underlying technical problem of disconnected
browser storage and execution contexts between the Next.js application and the
Shopify-hosted checkout. The tracking gap remains, and it must be bridged by
server-side logic.

#### **2.3.2 Event Deduplication: The Critical Component**

To avoid counting a single conversion twice (once by the Pixel on the frontend,
once by CAPI on the backend), Meta requires a process called event
deduplication. This is achieved by sending an identical, unique `event_id`
parameter with both the client-side event and its corresponding server-side
event.22 Meta's systems use this shared ID to recognize that the two events
represent the same user action and merge them into a single, enriched
conversion.21

For the utekos.no headless flow, this requires a manual, multi-step
implementation:

1. **Generation:** When a user initiates the checkout process from the Next.js
   application (e.g., by clicking a "Proceed to Checkout" button), the frontend
   code must generate a unique and persistent `event_id`.
2. **Client-Side Transmission:** This `event_id` must be included in the payload
   of the client-side Meta Pixel event that fires at this moment (e.g.,
   `InitiateCheckout`).
3. **State Handoff:** This same `event_id` must be passed along with the user's
   session as they are redirected to the Shopify checkout. The most direct
   method is to include it as a URL query parameter in the Shopify checkout URL.
4. **Server-Side Transmission:** After the customer successfully completes the
   purchase, a Shopify webhook is triggered, or the order confirmation data is
   otherwise made available to the server. The server-side logic responsible for
   sending the CAPI `Purchase` event must be able to retrieve that original
   `event_id` (e.g., from the order's metadata or note attributes where it was
   stored from the URL parameter) and include it in the CAPI payload sent to
   Meta.

The official "Facebook & Google" app within Shopify automatically handles event
deduplication for user journeys that occur _entirely within the Shopify
ecosystem_.22 The challenge here is that the journey _originates_ outside of
Shopify. Therefore, the manual CAPI implementation must be precisely configured
to bridge this gap, ensuring the final `Purchase` event sent from the server can
be correctly deduplicated against the `InitiateCheckout` event fired from the
Next.js frontend.

#### **2.3.3 Maximizing Event Match Quality (EMQ)**

Event Match Quality (EMQ) is a score from 1 to 10 that Meta assigns to
server-side events, indicating how effectively they can be matched to a Meta
user account. A higher EMQ score leads to more accurate reporting, better ad
optimization, and lower cost per result.21

The key advantage of CAPI is its ability to include rich, first-party customer
data that is unavailable to the client-side Pixel. After a successful purchase
on Shopify, the server has access to the complete customer record from the order
details, including their email address, phone number, full name, and shipping
address. The server-side logic that sends the CAPI `Purchase` event must be
programmed to collect as many of these customer information parameters as
possible, hash them securely according to Meta's specifications, and include
them in the `user_data` object of the CAPI payload.21 This is the single most
effective way to improve EMQ and maximize the value of the server-side
integration.

## **Part 3: E-commerce Integration and Developer Ecosystem: Shopify API 2025-10**

The Shopify API 2025-10 release introduces key enhancements focused on
increasing product scale, providing more granular control over logistics, and
continuing the evolution of its developer tooling. While the focus of this
report is narrower, these updates are relevant to any headless implementation
built on the platform.

### **3.1 Key Enhancements to the GraphQL Admin API (Version 2025-10)**

The GraphQL Admin API, the primary interface for managing store data, has
received several important updates.

For order management, the Orders query now supports filtering by
`current_total_price` and `total_weight`.26 This allows for the development of
more sophisticated backend automation, such as flagging high-value orders for
review or applying different shipping logic to heavy shipments.

Inventory management has been improved with the addition of new timestamp fields
on inventory shipments: `dateCreated`, `dateReceived`, and `dateShipped`.26
These fields provide much-needed visibility into the inventory lifecycle,
enabling more accurate stock level tracking and automated alerts. Furthermore,
the new `fulfillmentOrdersReroute` mutation provides a programmatic way to
redirect fulfillment orders to different locations, a critical feature for
businesses managing inventory across multiple warehouses or stores.26

A significant scaling enhancement is the increase of the product variant limit
from 100 to 2,048 for all merchants.27 To support this, mutations that handle
variants in bulk, such as `productSet`, `productVariantsBulkCreate`, and
`productVariantsBulkUpdate`, have been updated with new validation logic and a
dynamic complexity costing system that more accurately reflects the
computational cost of the operation.26

### **3.2 Storefront API and Headless Development Shifts**

Updates to the Storefront API and the broader Shopify developer ecosystem also
impact headless development.

The most notable change in the 2025-10 version of the GraphQL Storefront API is
that the Cart now supports adding multiple gift cards without replacing already
applied ones.27 This resolves a previous limitation and is an essential feature
for enabling a complete and user-friendly headless checkout experience.

In the wider developer ecosystem, Shopify has officially stabilized Polaris Web
Components, making them the new standard for building UIs in Shopify apps and
extensions. Consequently, the popular Polaris React library has been moved into
maintenance mode.29 While the utekos.no frontend is built with Next.js and
React, this strategic shift by Shopify towards framework-agnostic web components
is a significant industry trend. It signals a long-term direction towards more
interoperable and standardized UI development within the e-commerce ecosystem.

## **Conclusion: Synthesizing the Knowledge Gap for Optimized AI Collaboration**

The analysis of the Q4 2025 technology landscape reveals several fundamental
paradigm shifts that constitute a significant knowledge gap for AI models
trained on earlier data. To effectively collaborate with an AI assistant like
Gemini, it is crucial to internalize these new concepts and use them to
formulate precise, context-aware prompts.

### **Summary of Key Paradigm Shifts**

- **From Implicit to Explicit Control:** A clear trend across the stack is the
  move away from implicit, "magic" behaviors towards explicit developer control.
  In Next.js, the broad `experimental.ppr` flag has been replaced by the
  granular `use cache` directive and explicit `revalidateTag(tag, profile)`
  function. In React, the ambiguous dependency array dance with `useEffect` is
  clarified by the intentional `useEffectEvent` hook. This empowers developers
  with more predictable and debuggable control over performance and application
  lifecycle.
- **Automation of Optimization:** The stabilization of Turbopack as the default
  bundler and the integration of the React Compiler represent a major offloading
  of optimization responsibility from the developer to the toolchain. The new
  baseline for performance is significantly higher and requires less manual
  intervention. This allows for cleaner, more declarative, and more maintainable
  application code, as developers are freed from the boilerplate of manual
  memoization and complex bundler configuration.
- **Server-Side as Primary Truth:** The increasing unreliability of client-side
  tracking, especially in complex headless architectures, solidifies the Meta
  Conversions API as the source of truth for conversion data. A successful
  implementation is no longer just about firing events; it is an architectural
  challenge of maintaining data integrity and identity (via `event_id` and rich
  customer data for EMQ) across distributed systems and domain boundaries.

### **Actionable Recommendations for Prompting Gemini**

To bridge the knowledge gap, prompts directed at an AI assistant must be updated
to reflect the new vocabulary, primitives, and best practices. The following
examples illustrate this transition:

- **Topic: React Performance Optimization**
  - **Outdated Prompt:** "Optimize my React component for performance by adding
    `useMemo` and `useCallback`."
  - **Informed Prompt:** "My project uses Next.js 16 with the React Compiler
    enabled via `next.config.js`. Review this component and refactor it to
    remove any `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks that are now redundant,
    explaining why the compiler makes them unnecessary."
- **Topic: Next.js Caching**
  - **Outdated Prompt:** "How do I cache data on a Next.js page using
    `getStaticProps` and `revalidate`?"
  - **Informed Prompt:** "I need to implement a component-level,
    Stale-While-Revalidate caching strategy in Next.js 16. Show me how to use
    the `'use cache';` directive, fetch data with a specific tag, and then use
    the `revalidateTag(tag, 'max')` function within a Server Action to
    invalidate it."
- **Topic: Headless Conversion Tracking**
  - **Outdated Prompt:** "How do I track a purchase with the Meta Pixel on
    Shopify?"
  - **Informed Prompt:** "I have a headless Next.js site that redirects to
    Shopify for checkout. Detail the precise data flow required for correct Meta
    CAPI event deduplication. Specifically, show the code for: 1. Generating a
    unique `event_id` in the Next.js client. 2. Firing an `InitiateCheckout`
    Pixel event with that `event_id`. 3. Passing the `event_id` to the Shopify
    checkout URL. 4. Retrieving that `event_id` on the server after a Shopify
    webhook fires. 5. Sending a server-side `Purchase` CAPI event that includes
    the original `event_id` and hashed `user_data` to maximize EMQ."

By adopting this level of specificity, development teams can leverage AI
assistants as powerful, context-aware partners, accelerating development and
ensuring adherence to the latest architectural patterns.
