# Task Graph Basics

Foundation skill providing shared patterns, tool reference, and connection workflow for task-graph-mcp.

**This skill is automatically referenced by all other task-graph skills.**

> **Coordination patterns** (roles, phases, states, gates) are defined by
> workflow configs (`workflow-solo.yaml`, `workflow-hierarchical.yaml`, etc.)
> loaded at connect time. This skill covers the tools and patterns that are
> common across all workflows.

---

## Quick Start

```
# First thing in any session - connect as a worker
connect(tags=["code", "image-in"])
  Returns worker_id (SAVE THIS for all subsequent calls)

# Find work
list_tasks(ready=true, worker_id=worker_id)

# Claim and work
claim(worker_id=worker_id, task=task_id)
thinking(worker_id=worker_id, thought="Working on X...")
update(worker_id=worker_id, task=task_id, state="completed")
```

---

## Connection Workflow

Every worker MUST connect before using task-graph tools:

```
1. CONNECT
   connect(
     worker_id="worker-17",   # Only if assigned!
     tags=["code", "audio-out"], # Capabilities
   )
    Returns: worker_id
    SAVE THIS ID for all subsequent calls

2. WORK (use worker_id in all calls)
   list_tasks, claim, thinking, update, etc.

3. DISCONNECT (when done)
   disconnect(worker_id=worker_id)
    Releases all claims and locks
```

**Choosing a worker_id:**
- Only provide a worker_id if you've been assigned one that seems unique
- `"claude"` -> BAD (too generic, will collide)
- `"coordinator"` -> Likely OK (role-based, probably unique)
- `"worker-17"` -> Good (explicitly assigned)
- If you don't have an assigned name, **omit worker_id entirely** -- a unique
  petname will be generated for you automatically

**Tags enable task affinity:**
- `agent_tags_all` on tasks: Worker must have ALL (AND logic)
- `agent_tags_any` on tasks: Worker must have AT LEAST ONE (OR logic)

---

## CLI Agent Delegation

When running as a coordinator (MCP agent), you can spawn background CLI agents
for parallel work. CLI agents use `task-graph-mcp agent` subcommands instead of
MCP tool calls.

### Spawning a CLI Agent
```bash
# Start a background worker
task-graph-mcp agent connect my-worker-1 --tags build,test
# or auto-generate ID:
WORKER_ID=$(task-graph-mcp agent connect --format json | jq -r '.worker_id')
```

### CLI Agent Workflow
```bash
task-graph-mcp agent list-tasks --ready
task-graph-mcp agent claim <worker-id> <task-id>
task-graph-mcp agent update <worker-id> <task-id> --status completed
task-graph-mcp agent prompts --status working    # Get state guidance
task-graph-mcp agent prompts --advisory           # List advisory topics
task-graph-mcp agent disconnect <worker-id>
```

### Coordinator Responsibilities
- Create tasks and dependencies before spawning CLI agents
- Pass the database path if not using defaults: `--database <path>`
- Monitor progress: `task-graph-mcp agent list-tasks --status working`
- CLI agents should call `thinking` periodically for heartbeat

## MCP Resources

The server exposes **resources** that agents can read for live configuration,
documentation, and database queries. Use `list_resources` / `read_resource` (or
the equivalent MCP resource protocol) to access them.

### Query Resources (live database)

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `query://tasks/all` | Full task graph with dependencies |
| `query://tasks/ready` | Tasks ready to claim (deps satisfied, unclaimed) |
| `query://tasks/blocked` | Tasks blocked by dependencies |
| `query://tasks/claimed` | All currently claimed tasks |
| `query://tasks/agent/{agent_id}` | Tasks owned by a specific agent |
| `query://tasks/tree/{task_id}` | Task with all descendants |
| `query://files/marks` | All advisory file marks |
| `query://agents/all` | Registered agents |
| `query://stats/summary` | Aggregate statistics |

### Config Resources (active configuration)

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `config://current` | All configuration in one response (states, phases, deps, tags) |
| `config://states` | Task state definitions and transitions |
| `config://phases` | Work phase definitions |
| `config://dependencies` | Dependency type definitions |
| `config://tags` | Tag definitions and categories |

### Docs Resources (reference content)

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `docs://skills/list` | List all bundled skills |
| `docs://skills/{name}` | Get a specific skill (e.g., `docs://skills/basics`) |
| `docs://workflows/list` | List available workflow topologies |
| `docs://workflows/{name}` | Workflow details (states, phases, settings) |
| `docs://index` | List all documentation files |
| `docs://search/{query}` | Full-text search across documentation |
| `docs://{path}` | Read a specific doc file (e.g., `docs://GATES.md`) |

**Tip:** Read `config://current` early in your session to understand the active
state machine, available phases, and tag definitions without extra tool calls.

---

## Task States

States and transitions are defined by the active workflow config. The default
state machine (present in all workflows) is:

```
pending --> working --> completed
   |             |
   |             +--> failed --> pending (retry)
   |
   +--> cancelled
```

Workflows may add additional states (e.g., `assigned`, `consult`). See the
loaded workflow for the full state machine. Before adding custom states or
phases, consult `docs://WORKFLOW_CUSTOMIZATION` for the decision framework.

| Common State | Timed | Typical Exits |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| `pending` | No | `working`, `cancelled` |
| `working` | Yes | `completed`, `failed`, `pending` |
| `completed` | No | (terminal or `pending`) |
| `failed` | No | `pending` |
| `cancelled` | No | (terminal) |

**Timed states** (like `working`) automatically:
- Set owner when entering
- Track `time_actual_ms`
- Clear owner when leaving

> **Accounting rationale -- why you cannot skip timed states:**
> The state machine requires tasks to pass through a timed state (e.g.,
> `working`) before reaching `completed`. You cannot go directly from `pending`
> to `completed`. This exists because `time_actual_ms` is accumulated by
> measuring elapsed wall-clock time while a task sits in a timed state. Skipping
> the timed state would produce zero-duration records, breaking parent rollup
> totals, sprint velocity, and agent utilization metrics.
>
> **Pattern for coordinator/bookkeeping tasks:** Parent rollup tasks, umbrella
> tasks, and other bookkeeping items where no real work happens still need to
> transit through `working`. The transition can be immediate:
> ```
> update(task=task_id, state="working", worker_id=worker_id)
> update(task=task_id, state="completed", worker_id=worker_id)
> ```
> This records a minimal (near-zero) duration while keeping the audit trail and
> accounting system consistent.

## Unified Update Behavior

The `update` tool handles ownership based on state transitions:

```
Transition to TIMED state (e.g., working)
  CLAIMS task: validates tags, checks limit, sets owner

Transition to NON-TIMED state (e.g., pending)
  RELEASES task: clears owner

Transition to TERMINAL state (e.g., completed)
  COMPLETES task: checks children, releases file locks
```

**Force parameter:**
- `update(force=true)` takes ownership from another worker
- `claim(force=true)` same behavior (claim is shortcut for update)

---

## Task Trees

Use `create_tree` for hierarchical task structures:

```json
{
  "tree": {
    "title": "Feature X",
    "children": [
      {"title": "Design", "points": 3},
      {"title": "Implement", "points": 5},
      {"title": "Test", "points": 2}
    ]
  },
  "sibling_type": "follows"
}
```

**Top-level params:**
- `child_type` - Dependency from parent to children (default: "contains")
- `sibling_type` - Dependency between siblings ("follows" for sequential, null for parallel)

**Tree node fields:**
- `title` - Task title (required for new tasks)
- `ref` - Reference existing task by ID (other fields ignored)
- `id` - Custom task ID (UUID7 generated if omitted)
- `description`, `priority`, `points`, `time_estimate_ms`
- `tags`, `needed_tags`, `wanted_tags`
- `children` - Nested child nodes

**Reference existing tasks:**
```json
{ "ref": "existing-task-id" }
```

### Parallel Workstreams with Cross-Branch Dependencies

For complex patterns with parallel tracks, build the tree then add links:

```json
{
  "tree": {
    "title": "Sprint 5",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Backend Track",
        "children": [
          {"title": "API endpoints", "id": "api", "needed_tags": ["backend"]},
          {"title": "Database migrations", "id": "db", "needed_tags": ["database"]}
        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Frontend Track",
        "children": [
          {"title": "Component library", "id": "comp", "needed_tags": ["frontend"]},
          {"title": "Page integration", "id": "page", "needed_tags": ["frontend"]}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```
# Sequential deps within each track:
link(from="api", to="db", type="follows")
link(from="comp", to="page", type="follows")

# Cross-branch deps:
link(from="api", to="page", type="blocks")
```

### Scope Expansion via Relink

When a task's scope grows, move children atomically with `relink`:

```
# Task "Backend" has children A, B, C, D
# Split: keep A, B in Backend; move C, D to new "Database" sibling

# 1. Create new sibling task
create(title="Database", parent=grandparent_id)
  new_task_id

# 2. Atomic move
relink(
  prev_from="backend-task-id",
  prev_to=["child-c", "child-d"],
  from=new_task_id,
  to=["child-c", "child-d"],
  type="contains"
)
```

**Why relink vs unlink+link?**
- Single transaction: all changes succeed or none do
- No intermediate state where children are orphaned
- Validates constraints (single parent, no cycles) before committing

## Query Patterns

### Find available work
```
list_tasks(ready=true, worker_id=worker_id)
# Returns: unclaimed tasks with satisfied deps matching worker's tags
```

### Find blocked tasks
```
list_tasks(blocked=true)
# Returns: tasks waiting on dependencies
```

### Find my tasks
```
list_tasks(owner=worker_id)
# Returns: tasks I've claimed
```

### Get root tasks only
```
list_tasks(parent="null")
# Returns: top-level tasks
```

### Get formatted output
```
list_tasks(format="markdown")
get(task=task_id, children=true, format="markdown")
```

### Search tasks
```
search(query="authentication")
# Returns: ranked results with highlighted snippets

search(query="auth", include_attachments=true, status_filter="pending")
# Returns: pending tasks matching "auth" in title, description, or attachments
```

### Search vs list_tasks

| Use Case | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Find ready tasks for your tags | `list_tasks(ready=true)` |
| Find tasks by keyword | `search(query="keyword")` |
| Filter by status only | `list_tasks(status="pending")` |
| Find tasks with specific content | `search(query="...")` |
| Check your claimed tasks | `list_tasks(owner=worker_id)` |
| Find tasks mentioning a topic | `search(query="topic")` |

---

## Best Practices

### Always Do
- Save your `worker_id` after connecting
- Use `thinking()` frequently to show progress
- Mark files before editing (`mark_file`)
- Check `mark_updates` before editing shared files or when seeing edit conflicts
- Log costs with `log_cost` for tracking

### Never Do
- Claim tasks without checking dependencies
- Edit files without advisory locks
- Leave tasks in limbo (always update state)
- Ignore tag requirements on tasks

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Task already claimed" | Another worker owns it | Use `force=true` or pick another |
| "Dependencies not satisfied" | Blockers incomplete | Wait or help complete blockers |
| "Worker ID already registered" | Name collision | Omit worker_id to get a unique petname |
| "Worker not found" | Invalid/expired worker_id | Reconnect (let stale reaping clean up old) |
| "Tag mismatch" | Worker lacks required tags | Check `agent_tags_all`/`agent_tags_any` |
