/**
 * @description A client component that initializes and provides the cart mutation machine to its children via React Context.
 * This component acts as the integration point or "Composition Root" for the cart's state logic. Its primary purpose is to
 * connect the abstract state machine with the application's specific implementation details (server actions and data caching).
 * By centralizing this setup, we ensure that any child component can access a single, consistent instance of the cart
 * machine without needing to know how it was created, promoting a clean separation of concerns.
 * @param {object} props - The component props.
 * @param {CartActions} props.actions - The concrete implementation of server actions for cart mutations. This dependency injection allows for easy testing and swapping of implementations.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - The child components that will consume the provided machine actor.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The context provider that makes the cart machine actor available to the component tree.
