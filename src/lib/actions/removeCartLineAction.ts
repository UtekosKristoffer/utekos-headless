/**
 * @fileoverview Server action for removing a line item from the cart.
 *
 *   This module exposes a single function that orchestrates removal by
 *   validating the input, executing the API mutation and formatting any
 *   errors.  The action only performs the high‑level steps implied by its
 *   name and relies on helpers for the underlying details.  Isolating these
 *   concerns helps maintain clarity and ensures that AI assistants can
 *   understand the intent and expected outcomes of the code.
