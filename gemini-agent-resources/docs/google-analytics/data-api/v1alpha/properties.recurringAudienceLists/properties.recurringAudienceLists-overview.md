| `activeDaysRemaining` | `integer` Optional. The number of remaining days that a recurring audience export will produce an audience list instance. This counter decreases by one each day, and when it reaches zero, no new audience lists will be created. Recurring audience list request for Analytics 360 properties default to 180 days and have a maximum of 365 days. Requests for standard Analytics properties default to 14 days and have a maximum of 30 days. The minimum value allowed during creation is 1\. Requests above their respective maximum will be coerced to their maximum.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `webhookNotification` | `object (WebhookNotification)` Optional. Configures webhook notifications to be sent from the Google Analytics Data API to your webhook server. Use of webhooks is optional. If unused, you'll need to poll this API to determine when a recurring audience list creates new audience lists. Webhooks allow a notification to be sent to your servers & avoid the need for polling. Two POST requests will be sent each time a recurring audience list creates an audience list. This happens once per day until a recurring audience list reaches 0 active days remaining. The first request will be sent showing a newly created audience list in its CREATING state. The second request will be sent after the audience list completes creation (either the ACTIVE or FAILED state). |
