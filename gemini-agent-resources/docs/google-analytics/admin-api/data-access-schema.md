When using the Google Analytics User Interface, each report card can result in one or more data access events. Consequently, navigating through the Google Analytics User Interface can result in more access events than the number of reports viewed. |
| `dataApiQuotaPropertyTokensConsumed` | Data API quota property tokens consumed | All Google Analytics Properties | Returns the total property quota tokens consumed for Data API requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
