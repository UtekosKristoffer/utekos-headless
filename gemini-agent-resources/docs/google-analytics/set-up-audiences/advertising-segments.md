An advertising segment in Google Analytics is the list of users in Google
Analytics that are synced with Google Advertising products for use in
remarketing and ads personalization.

Your Google Analytics advertising segments include users collected by Google
Analytics, and sent to advertising products for use in ads personalization.
These can be viewed, including their ads personalization eligible list sizes, in
the Advertising segments panel of the Google Analytics Advertising section.
These sizes match what is shown in
[the Google Ads Audience Manager](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7558048#listsize).
