# Render-blocking requests

Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring
or inlining can move these network requests out of the critical path.

## How to pass this insight

This insight highlights requests that prevented the first paint of the page. To
pass this insight, remove all such render-blocking requests.

Some strategies for reducing the impact of render-blocking requests include:

- Defer requests that are not needed for first-paint.
- Inline requests that are critical for first-paint, but small.
- Reduce the content of CSS or scripts to just what is necessary for the first
  paint.

> [!IMPORTANT] **Important:** Inlining CSS is an advanced performance technique
> that can improve performance, but can also lead to bugs if not implemented
> properly. **Most sites should be able to achieve all of our recommended
> performance targets without implementing this technique.**

## Stack-specific guidance

This insight also offers stack-specific guidance for pages using the following
technologies:

### AMP

Use tools such as
[AMP Optimizer](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-toolbox/tree/master/packages/optimizer)
to
[server-side render AMP layouts](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/server-side-rendering/).

### Drupal

Consider using [a module](https://www.drupal.org/project/critical_css) to inline
critical CSS and JavaScript, and use the defer attribute for non-critical CSS or
JavaScript.

### Joomla

There are a number of Joomla plugins that can help you
[inline critical assets](https://extensions.joomla.org/instant-search/?jed_live%5Bquery%5D=performance)
or
[defer less important resources](https://extensions.joomla.org/instant-search/?jed_live%5Bquery%5D=performance).

### WordPress

There are a number of WordPress plugins that can help you
[inline critical assets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/critical+css/) or
[defer less important resources](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/defer+css+javascript/).
