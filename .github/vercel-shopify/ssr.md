# Text content does not match server-rendered HTML

## Why This Error Occurred

While rendering your application, there was a difference between the React tree
that was pre-rendered from the server and the React tree that was rendered
during the first render in the browser (**hydration**).

> **Hydration** is when React converts the pre-rendered HTML from the server
> into a fully interactive application by attaching event handlers.

---

## Common Causes

Hydration errors can occur from:

- **Incorrect nesting of HTML tags**
  - `<p>` nested in another `<p>` tag
  - `<div>` nested in a `<p>` tag
  - `<ul>` or `<ol>` nested in a `<p>` tag
- **Interactive content cannot be nested**
  - `<a>` nested in an `<a>` tag
  - `<button>` nested in a `<button>` tag
- **Using checks like** `typeof window !== 'undefined'` **in your rendering
  logic**
- **Using browser-only APIs** like `window` or `localStorage` in your rendering
  logic
- **Using time-dependent APIs** such as the `Date()` constructor in your
  rendering logic
- **Browser extensions** modifying the HTML
- **Incorrectly configured CSS-in-JS libraries**
- **Incorrectly configured Edge/CDN** that attempts to modify the HTML response
  (e.g., Cloudflare Auto Minify)

> **Tip:** Ensure your code is following
> [official Next.js examples](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Possible Ways to Fix It

### Solution 1: Using `useEffect` to run on the client only

Ensure that the component renders the same content server-side as it does during
the initial client-side render to prevent a hydration mismatch. You can
intentionally render different content on the client with the `useEffect` hook:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  return <h1>{isClient ? 'This is never prerendered' : 'Prerendered'}</h1>
}
```

During React hydration, `useEffect` is called. This means browser APIs like
`window` are available to use without hydration mismatches.

### Solution 2: Disabling SSR on specific components

Next.js allows you to disable prerendering on specific components, which can
prevent hydration mismatches:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const NoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/no-ssr'), { ssr: false })

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NoSSR />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Solution 3: Using `suppressHydrationWarning`

Sometimes content will inevitably differ between the server and client, such as
a timestamp. You can silence the hydration mismatch warning by adding
`suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the element:

```tsx
<time datetime='2016-10-25' suppressHydrationWarning />
```

> **Note:**
>
> - This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Donâ€™t
>   overuse it.
> - React will not attempt to patch mismatched text content when
>   `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` is set.

## Common iOS Issues

iOS attempts to detect phone numbers, email addresses, and other data in text
content and convert them into links, leading to hydration mismatches.

This can be disabled with the following meta tag:

```html
<meta
  name="format-detection"
  content="telephone=no, date=no, email=no, address=no"
/>
```
