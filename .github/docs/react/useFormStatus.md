# useFormStatus

## Overview

`useFormStatus` is a Hook that gives you status information of the last form
submission.

```js
const { pending, data, method, action } = useFormStatus()
```

---

## Description

The `useFormStatus` Hook provides status information of the last form
submission.

```js
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'
import action from './actions'

function Submit() {
  const status = useFormStatus()
  return <button disabled={status.pending}>Submit</button>
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <Submit />
    </form>
  )
}
```

To get status information, the `Submit` component must be rendered within a
`<form>`. The Hook returns information like the `pending` property which tells
you if the form is actively submitting.

In the above example, `Submit` uses this information to disable `<button>`
presses while the form is submitting.

---

## Parameters

`useFormStatus` does not take any parameters.

---

## Returns

A status object with the following properties:

- **pending**: `boolean`  
   If `true`, this means the parent `<form>` is pending submission. Otherwise,
  `false`.

- **data**: `FormData | null`  
   An object implementing the FormData interface that contains the data the
  parent `<form>` is submitting. If there is no active submission or no parent
  `<form>`, it will be `null`.

- **method**: `'get' | 'post'`  
   A string value of either `'get'` or `'post'`. This represents whether the
  parent `<form>` is submitting with either a GET or POST HTTP method. By
  default, a `<form>` will use the GET method and can be specified by the
  `method` property.

- **action**: `Function | null`  
   A reference to the function passed to the `action` prop on the parent
  `<form>`. If there is no parent `<form>`, the property is `null`. If there is
  a URI value provided to the `action` prop, or no `action` prop specified,
  `status.action` will be `null`.

---

## Caveats

- The `useFormStatus` Hook must be called from a component that is rendered
  inside a `<form>`.
- `useFormStatus` will only return status information for a parent `<form>`. It
  will not return status information for any `<form>` rendered in that same
  component or children components.

---

## Usage

### Display a pending state during form submission

To display a pending state while a form is submitting, you can call the
`useFormStatus` Hook in a component rendered in a `<form>` and read the
`pending` property returned.

Here, we use the `pending` property to indicate the form is submitting.

```js
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'
import { submitForm } from './actions.js'

function Submit() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()
  return (
    <button type='submit' disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )
}

function Form({ action }) {
  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <Submit />
    </form>
  )
}

export default function App() {
  return <Form action={submitForm} />
}
```

---

### Pitfall

`useFormStatus` will not return status information for a `<form>` rendered in
the same component.  
The `useFormStatus` Hook only returns status information for a parent `<form>`
and not for any `<form>` rendered in the same component calling the Hook, or
child components.

```js
function Form() {
  // ðŸš© `pending` will never be true
  // useFormStatus does not track the form rendered in this component
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()
  return <form action={submit}></form>
}
```

Instead call `useFormStatus` from inside a component that is located inside
`<form>`.

```js
function Submit() {
  // âœ… `pending` will be derived from the form that wraps the Submit component
  const { pending } = useFormStatus()
  return <button disabled={pending}>...</button>
}

function Form() {
  // This is the <form> `useFormStatus` tracks
  return (
    <form action={submit}>
      <Submit />
    </form>
  )
}
```

---

### Read the form data being submitted

You can use the `data` property of the status information returned from
`useFormStatus` to display what data is being submitted by the user.

Here, we have a form where users can request a username. We can use
`useFormStatus` to display a temporary status message confirming what username
they have requested.

**UsernameForm.js**

```js
import { useState, useMemo, useRef } from 'react'
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'

export default function UsernameForm() {
  const { pending, data } = useFormStatus()

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Request a Username: </h3>
      <input type='text' name='username' disabled={pending} />
      <button type='submit' disabled={pending}>
        Submit
      </button>
      <br />
      <p>{data ? `Requesting ${data?.get('username')}...` : ''}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**App.js**

```js
import UsernameForm from './UsernameForm'
import { submitForm } from './actions.js'
import { useRef } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const ref = useRef(null)
  return (
    <form
      ref={ref}
      action={async formData => {
        await submitForm(formData)
        ref.current.reset()
      }}
    >
      <UsernameForm />
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### status.pending is never true

`useFormStatus` will only return status information for a parent `<form>`.

If the component that calls `useFormStatus` is not nested in a `<form>`,
`status.pending` will always return `false`. Verify `useFormStatus` is called in
a component that is a child of a `<form>` element.

`useFormStatus` will not track the status of a `<form>` rendered in the same
component. See Pitfall for more details.
